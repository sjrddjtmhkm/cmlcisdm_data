5 The reasons for the decision
The case with case number 200.253.573 / 01


5.1
On behalf of the mother , the appeal in the case with case number 200.253.573 / 01 (concerning the access arrangements between the mother and the minor ) was withdrawn at the hearing . The court concludes from this that the mother does not uphold the grounds of the appeal in this case. This means that the court will declare the mother inadmissible in its appeal on this case. The case with case number 200.253.574 / 01


5.2
Only the access arrangement between the father and the minor is still in dispute between the parties .
5.3
The documents submitted show that the minor was removed from home at the beginning of 2018 because an unsafe home situation had arisen for him as a result of the fierce divorce battle between his parents . On the basis of the family investigation in the home situation of the mother , completed by J in February 2019, video interaction guidance is currently being used to work towards an arrangement whereby the minor will stay with the mother in the weekends . The family investigation with the father will soon be started.
5.4
In September 2018, the minor 's foster family made a report of concern to the GI about statements by the minor that would indicate sexual abuse by the father . The mother then filed a report under the direction of K and the vice squad, after which the contact between the father and the minor was stopped by the GI . In the contested decision, the court determined that the relationship between the father and the minor must be rebuilt. The father currently has one hour of interaction with the minor once every two weeks under supervision of the GI. The association has already taken place three times in this way. The (video) call contacts between the father and the minor were stopped after consultation between the father , the foster care worker and the foster mother , because these were considered too burdensome for the minor .
5.5
From the documents submitted it appears that several interrogations have already taken place in the criminal investigation into possible sexual abuse of the minor by the father . A studio interview of the minor took place, this was worked out on October 16, 2018. The mother had access to the report of this hearing on March 26, 2019 and she changed her requests after telephone consultation with L and E, among others. The mother takes the position that further investigation must take place and that, pending the results thereof, theinteraction between the father and the minor must be stopped. The father stated at the hearing that it is not clear when the public prosecutor will decide or prosecute.
5.6
The court of appeal must assess whether there is sufficient reason at this time to stop intercourse between the father and the minor . In the opinion of the court, that is not the case. The Court of Appeal considers it to be in the best interests of the minor that as long as there is still a lack of clarity about the accusations , the supervised contact between the father and the minor will continue from one hour every two weeks. In this judgment, the Court of Appeal takes into account that the family guardian stated at the hearing that the interaction moments between the father and theminor went well and that the minor himself indicates that he would like to see his father more often. The Court of Appeal therefore does not consider it to be in the best interests of the minor to stop abruptly dealing with his father again. after all, the minor could also see this as a rejection of himself and / or this could unnecessarily cause fear for his father , which may make further contact recovery in the future more difficult. The Court of Appeal is of the opinion that the safety of the minor must come first and that theaccess control must therefore continue to be (intensively) supervised by the GI. At the hearing it appeared that during the last intercourse the police interviews were brought up by the father . Regardless of how that went exactly, in the opinion of the Court of Appeal it does mean that the GI is expected to receive more intensive supervision than was the case during that interaction . Steps must be held that the minor established a link between the statements he has made and the discontinuation of dealing with his father , making minor feel burdened or even guilty. The agreements made with both parents that the minor does not discuss the allegations of sexual abuse have not been sufficient to prevent this and the trust and privacy that the family guardian has wanted to grant to the father and the minor during dealings. are therefore no longer in place.
5.7
The family guardian stated at the hearing that the GI will use independent investigation into the allegations of sexual abuse of the minor by the father . The Court of Appeal considers it important that this investigation will be started soon. The Court of Appeal also takes into account that it cannot be ruled out at the present time that the behavior for which the minor receives play therapy (anger attacks, difficulty in indicating boundaries and wishes) originates in the serious loyalty conflict in which he is a result of the disturbedrelationship between his parents still is. In that context, it is also up to the GI to properly monitor how the minor responds to intercourse with the mother , especially now that it has been suggested at the hearing that intercourse with the mother will be further expanded in the short term.
5.8
The Court of Appeal sees no reason at present for ordering other investigations .
5.9
On the basis of the foregoing, the Court of Appeal will establish an access arrangement between the father and the minor, on the basis of which from now on they will interact for one hour once every two weeks under the supervision of the GI, all this taking into account the 5.6 considered. In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, further development of the relationship is not necessary as long as there is no clarity about the allegations of sexual abuse of the minor by the father. In view of this, the Court of Appeal will partly ratify and partly annul the contested decision. In the case with case number 200.253.574 / 02


5.10
In view of the decision in the main action with case number 200.253.574 / 01, there is no longer any interest in granting the application for suspension , so that the court will reject that request.
