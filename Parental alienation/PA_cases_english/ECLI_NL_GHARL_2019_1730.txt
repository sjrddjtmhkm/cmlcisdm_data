Content indication
â€œFor a large number of sexual offenses and attempts at sixteen underage boys, the suspect is sentenced to an unconditional prison sentence of four years and the measure of provision with conditions. In addition, the court allocates various amounts to compensation. The defendant committed physical sexual acts to four of his victims, whom he knew through his involvement in a basketball club . The other twelve victims were often persuaded by the accused via the internet to perform sexual acts on themselves or on others. In addition, the accused has made a habit of distributing and making child pornography. The court will impose a lower prison sentence than these facts justify in themselves. The suspect is less accountable. The court of appeal also sees the importance of treating the suspect, so that the risk of recurrence can be reduced. In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, this latter interest must currently outweigh the interests involved in continuing pre-trial detention. The Court of Appeal declares the provision of posting immediately enforceable, so that the treatment of the suspect can commence immediately. Due to the conditions attached to the posting, the treatment is sufficiently certain. At the same time, these conditions provide sufficient protection for society . "

Contradiction

Short judgment of the multiple chamber for criminal cases

recalled the appeal, brought against the judgment of the Midden-Nederland District Court of 6 January 2017 with public prosecutor number 16-705278-16 in the criminal case against

suspect ,

born at birth place on 1967,

at the time of the investigation at the hearing of this court of 29 January 2019 residing in PI Utrecht - HvB location Nieuwegein in Nieuwegein.

The appeal

The suspect appealed against the aforementioned judgment.

Investigation of the case

This judgment was given in connection with the investigation at the court hearings of 21 November 2017 and 29 January 2019 and, in accordance with the provisions of Article 422 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the investigation at the court hearing in first instance.

The Court of Appeal has taken note of the advocate general's claim. This claim was submitted to the court after reading. The Court of Appeal also took cognizance of what was put forward by the accused and his counsel, JWH Peters.

The judgment whose appeal

The court of appeal will set aside the judgment of which an appeal is made because it comes to a partly different evidence decision and it takes a different decision with regard to the penalty and measure. The court will therefore do justice again.

The indictment

The full text of the indictment is attached to this judgment as an appendix.

Eighteen (series of) incidents were charged to the accused in various ways. In essence, the accusations amount to the following.

Suspect has performed sexual acts with victim 1, victim 2, victim 3 and victim 4. This happened at times in the years 2000 through 2002 when all the victims were younger than sixteen. These were physical sexual acts in which, in the case of victim 1, the suspect also entered the body of victim 1.

In 2013, the suspect victim 5 was forced to undergo sexual acts.

At times in the years 2014 through 2016, the accused performed sexual acts via the internet with boys under the age of sixteen. These were victim 6, victim 7, victim 8, victim 9, victim 10, victim 11, victim 12, victim 13 and victim 14. In addition, he has tried in this way to perform sexual acts with victim 15 and victim 16.

Victim 17, who was younger than sixteen, showed suspect images in 2015 and 2016.

Finally suspect in 2015 and 2016 child pornography distributed and another child made.

These are the accusations on which the court must judge.

Admissibility of the Public Prosecution Service in prosecuting fact 4

The court has declared the Public Prosecution Service inadmissible in the prosecution of fact 4. To that end, the court has considered, concretely, that for this fact no complaint has been filed and no declaration has been made, while on the basis of the file it cannot be ruled out is that the accused under 4 took place in the period before 1 October 2002, when the complaint requirement for sex crimes still applied and a complaint should therefore have been submitted in this case.

Unlike the court, the court of appeal is of the opinion that the Public Prosecution Service is admissible in prosecuting this fact. The indictment is tailored to both Article 247 and 249 of the Criminal Code . At the time of the acts charged, there was no complaint requirement for Article 249 of the Criminal Code . With regard to Article 247 of the Criminal Code , there is a situation as referred to in Article 247, second paragraph, of the Criminal Code (old). It states, in essence, that the complaint requirement does not apply in the cases of articles 248 and 249. Given the concurrence of articles 247 and 249 of the Criminal Codetherefore, in the case referred to under 4, filing a complaint was not required in this case, so that the Public Prosecution Service is also admissible in prosecuting the charge charged based on Article 247 of the Criminal Code .

Partial acquittal of fact 1 and acquittal of fact 5

The court of appeal, like the court, is of the opinion that the accused should be acquitted of the charges under 1 insofar as this relates to the performance of acts that (partly) consisted of the sexual penetration of the body of a minor below the twelve years. The legal and convincing evidence is missing, because the file contains both clues that victim 1 was younger than twelve years old, but also clues that victim 1 was older than twelve years old when the sexual abuse took place (for the first time).

Furthermore, the Court of Appeal did not obtain the conviction from the investigation at the hearing - and unlike the Advocate General - that the accused had committed the charges under 5, so that the accused should be acquitted.

Consideration regarding the evidence

Advocate General's Opinion

The Advocate General has, in addition to the aforementioned partial acquittal of fact 1, sought proof of the alleged facts. As regards the statement of evidence for facts 1 to 4, it has stated, concisely and concisely, that there is no reason to doubt the authenticity and reliability of the statements of victim 1, victim 2, victim 3 and victim 4, now these statements find sufficient support in the other contents of the file and the defendant's disputing of these facts, to the extent that this is the case, is always refuted by the means of proof.

With regard to facts 6 up to and including 18, the Advocate General referred to the evidence included in that regard in the court's judgment and the statement made by the defendant in respect of these facts at the court hearing on 21 November 2017. The Advocate General has concluded that these facts can be proved on that basis.

Defense position

The lawyer advocated partial acquittal with regard to fact 1 and to that end stated briefly and concisely that the statements made by victim 1 about the time when the anal penetration and the frequency with which the other sexual acts would have taken place should be unreliable and manifestly false. be considered. In addition, counsel has argued that for the statements of victim 1

- other than the statements made by the suspect - no proof of support is available. Regarding the nature of the proven sexual acts and the frequency with which these acts took place, according to the lawyer must be in line with what the accused stated about them.

The lawyer also argued for acquittal of the facts 2 and 3 and to that end, argued concisely, that the suspect had denied these facts and that, apart from the statements of victim 2 and victim 3, there was no evidence that the suspect had committed these facts.

Regarding fact 4, the lawyer did not comment on the question of evidence.

Counsel did not defend facts 6 to 18 and did not plead acquittal. The lawyer has indicated that he will refer to the opinion of the Court of Appeal regarding the statement of evidence of these facts.

The judgment of the court

The Court of Appeal is of the opinion that the defenses conducted by and on behalf of the accused seeking acquittal of the accused are contradicted by the evidence used, as they will later be included in the possible supplement to this judgment. The court of appeal has no reason to doubt the accuracy and reliability of the content of those means of proof.

Fact 1

On December 9, 2015, victim 1 reported sexual abuse committed by the suspect. victim 1 knows the suspect of the basketball club. victim 1 stated that the abuse took place for the first time when he played a computer game on the top floor of the accused 's home . During the game, the suspect began to touch him. The suspect put his hand in the pants of victim 1, he opened his pants and started to masturbate victim 1. Later on, the actions also consisted of the victim's blowjob. Furthermore, victim 1 stated that he had to penetrate the suspect anal. The suspect then picked up lubricant.

victim 1 has also sucked and deducted the suspect. The actions took place 30 to 40 times over a period of approximately six months. victim 1 was then in group 8 of primary school. It stopped when victim 1 was halfway through the end of twelve. victim 1 then stopped playing basketball.

At the hearing of the court and the court of appeal, the accused stated that he had deducted and sucked in victim 1, while the victim 1 was at the computer in the accused's home. This has happened more often, according to the suspect. According to the accused, victim 1 was 14 or 15 years old when these acts took place. Furthermore, the defendant stated that he had been anally penetrated by victim 1 when victim 1 was of age . The suspect then took lubricant because it hurt.

The father of victim 1 stated that he noticed that his son visited his trainer ( the court understands: suspect ) a lot at home. When he asked victim 1 about it, victim 1 responded very fiercely. victim 1 suddenly wanted to get rid of basketball after six months. He really wanted to get rid of it. The father thought it was not normal for the man to bring in victim 1 with a reasonable frequency. While making the statement, the father comes to mind that the coach had told victim 1 that victim 1 was good at basketball and that he would get more information about the training (at the coach's home) .

Fact 2

On January 7, 2016, victim 2 filed a report of sexual abuse against a suspect . victim 2 stated that the suspect had been his basketball coach for a period of time. The actions took place at the suspect's home, at times when victim 2 was playing a computer game there. victim 2 was then approximately 15 years. The suspect pulled victim 2 onto his lap and then began to touch him by the cross. This happened about ten times, according to victim 2. It happened once that victim 2 and suspect - possibly frolicking - ended up on the bed in the computer room. The suspect then lay on top of victim 2 and kissed him in the neck.

The father of victim 1 stated that during a conversation with victim 2 he saw that he reacted physically and went completely white when he told him about the incidents between his son and suspect. He heard victim 2 then say: stop it, it happened to me too.

The witness has stated that around 2012 he learned from victim 2 that he had been abused by the accused . victim 2 told him that he had been touched by the defendant several times when he sat on the defendant's lap and played a computer game.

The defendant stated that victim 2 sometimes came to his house to play computer games, that they sometimes played around and that it may be true that they ended up on the bed in the computer room.

Fact 3

victim 3 has reported the suspect, who has been his coach for several years. victim 3 has stated that the suspect was in him during a team weekend in Port ZÃ©lande in Zeeland. victim 3 woke up and noticed that the suspect was touching him with his underpants and penis. victim 3 was then 15 years old.

During his first police interrogation on the question whether things had happened between him and younger boys that could be a reason to go to the police, the suspect stated that he had been in Zeeland during a basketball camp with victim 3 and that an incident occurred at that time. occurred from which victim 3 was shocked.

Fact 4

Victim 4 has stated that he was at the basketball club and that when Defendant 4 was on the computer at the defendant's home, the defendant rubbed him over his back, went with his hand in his pants, and that the defendant tried to loosen the knots of his pants .

The mother of victim 4 wrote down in 2005 what would have happened in October / November 2001. In that letter she mentions that victim 4 came home after a visit to the suspect and asked whether the suspect was gay. When asked why he asked, victim 4 replied that suspect victim 4 started stroking his back when victim 4 was playing a game behind the computer. Over time, stroking the back turned into touching the sexual part of victim 4. The motherwrites further that she went to the suspect a few days after this incident and that she had confronted him with the incident as described by victim 4. The suspect said that it had indeed happened and that he was shocked.

The accused has acknowledged that he was approached by the mother of victim 4 about an incident that would have occurred between him and victim 4.

Joint evidence consideration of facts 1-4

According to the statements of victim 1, victim 2, victim 3 and victim 4, the defendant committed sexually abusive acts with them in the period 2000 to 2002. They knew the suspect of basketball. Suspect was the coach / trainer of the boys.

The Defendant's statement of victim 1 partly confirmed in the sense that he has a number of indecent acts cited by victims first known, although this indecent acts as suspect allegedly took place in 2004 and partly later, when the victim first age was . However, the court of appeal assumes that the abusive acts took place earlier, namely in the time (2001-2002) that victim 1 was in basketball. It follows from his father 's statement that victim 1 came to the defendant's home precisely during that period.

victim 1 has stated that the defendant committed the abusive acts , or at least began when the victim 1 was sitting at the top of the computer at the defendant's house.

Victim 4 also stated that the suspect was putting his hand in the pants of victim 4 when victim 4 was sitting at the suspect's home at the computer. The mother of victim 4 wrote in 2005 that she had confronted the suspect in 2001 with the fact that he (a few days before) had been on the genitals of victim 4 and that the suspect subsequently admitted this. The defendant has confirmed that the mother of victim 4 has been called to account for his behavior with victim 4.

Victim 2 also stated that during the same period he was sexually assaulted by the suspect while playing a computer game at the suspect's home.

Lastly, victim 3 also stated that the defendant attacked him indecisively in 2001, albeit not at the defendant's home, but during a team weekend in Zeeland.

In the opinion of the court of appeal, the statements of victim 1 and victim 4 find sufficient confirmation in other evidence, namely (as regards victim 1) in the statement of the suspect and (as regards victim 4) in the (written) statement of the mother of victim 4.

From the statements of victim 1 and victim 4, it follows that the suspect was sexually interested in boys between the ages of 12 and 15 in the period 2000-2002 and that the suspect was willing to cross the threshold of criminal law in order to express his sexual feelings for these boys. The Court of Appeal therefore considers these statements to be a reason for the charges under 2 (victim 2) and 3 (victim 3) as it concerns sexual behavior with respect to boys in the same age category, in the same period and where there was also a relationship between the suspect and the boys as a result of their activities in basketball.

Furthermore, the statements victim 2 and victim 3 also find some support in statements made by the suspect himself. The credibility of the statement of victim 2 is finally increased by the witness, who states that victim 2 had told him well before the report about the abuse .

Finally, the Court of Appeal noted in this connection that no evidence emerged from the file or the other items traded at the hearing that the victims had coordinated their statements or that they had conspired against the accused, as alleged by the accused.

The Court of Appeal concludes that it has been legally and convincingly proven that the accused committed the charges under 1 to 4, as included below under Proof of Evidence .

Facts 6 to 18

Like the advocate general and the defense, the court considers it legally and convincingly proven that the defendant committed the charges under 6 to 18.

Proof of declaration

By legal means of proof, whereby the content of each means of evidence - also in parts - is only used as proof of the alleged offense to which it appears evidently in the content, and which contains the reasoning facts and circumstances on which the statement of evidence is based, considers the court to be legally and convincingly proven that the accused committed the charges under 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, provided that:

The Court of Appeal suggests that the public prosecutor should charge a more limited number of facts in similar cases in the future. In this case, the same factual act has always been charged, alternatively and cumulatively, as two or even three different offenses. To the extent that the Public Prosecution Service had doubts about the provability of these facts, a primary subsidiary indictment could have been sufficient. For determining the sentence, an extensive indictment like this has no added value. Insofar as there is no question of a single coincidence as referred to in Article 55 of the Criminal Code and therefore only one penalty provision will always be applied, there will be multiple coincidence as meant in Article 57 of the Code ofCriminal law . The legal maximum penalty will then soon be reached. The various reprehensible aspects of the suspect's actions can also be involved in the sentence without separate indictment. The Court of Appeal notes that an excess of criminal law technology can obscure what has actually happened.

Punishability of the suspect

Suspect is punishable since no circumstance has been found or has become plausible that would not make suspect punishable.

Imposition of punishment and / or measure

The punishment to be reported below is in accordance with the nature and the seriousness of the proven evidence and the circumstances in which this was committed, also in view of the person of the accused, as was shown during the investigation at the hearing.

The Court of Appeal, in particular, took into account the following circumstances in the award of the sentence, which are reasons for the choice of an unconditional custodial sentence for the duration to be specified below.

Penalty

The suspect has made no fewer than sixteen children the victim of a sexual offense or he has tried that. He has committed physical sexual acts with four of them . Of the other twelve, he has persuaded many over the internet to perform sexual acts on himself or with others. At the same time, he made a habit of spreading child pornography and making other child pornography .

Of the first four boys, victim 1 was not older than twelve when the suspect forced himself on him. The suspect has masturbated and piped victim 1. He has led victim 1 to blow and masturbate him and to penetrate it once. The sexual acts between suspect and victim 1 took place several times, always at home with the suspect.

victim 2, victim 3 and victim 4 were between thirteen and fifteen years old when the suspect touched them in their crotch, near or over the penis. For victim 2 this happened several times and the suspect also kissed him once in the neck. In the case of victim 3 and victim 4, the suspect also tried to get into their underpants. victim 2 and victim 4 happened to this at the suspect's home. Victim 3 was groped during a basketball team trip where the suspect was the trainer .

In all four cases it concerned situations in which these children were entrusted to the suspect. As the adult in the house and even more as a basketball coach, he was responsible for the well-being of the children . He received the trust of their parents and the children themselves, with whom he had built up a bond , whether or not as a trainer . This trust has shamed and abused the defendant . Not the respect for the children and their happiness were the most important to him, but his own feelings and desires.

The consequences for the children have been great, both then and now. This is not just a general rule of experience. It can also be heard in the victim statements made. victim 1 tells about his poor self-image as a result of the sexual abuse . He experiences shame and uncontrollable emotions that have strongly influenced his life. Until today he becomes psychologicaltreated. victim 2 states in his victim statement that the suspect still has difficulty trusting other men. His confidence in himself has also been compromised. The court understands that both had to walk around with their secret and this burden for years. The fact that they are now talking about what happened is a testament to their courage and hopefully makes their burden a little lighter.

At the time, the accused had not given any account of the consequences of his actions and now he still does not. He does not recognize his mistakes and the suffering of his victims. Instead , he accuses them of lies and conspiracies.

However, he is the one who does not speak the truth here.

All this alone would suffice for a heavy prison sentence. However, there is more.

The suspect has approached twelve boys between the ages of twelve and fifteen via the internet. He pretended to be a fourteen-year-old girl who was after sex. He sent the boys nude photos of that girl. With this he tried to persuade them to perform sexual acts for the webcam. Many boys succeeded. On several occasions the suspect also directed the boys to perform sexual acts in front of the camera on another child . This also happened once, during which suspect camera images were recorded.

At the court hearing, the defendant also said that there have been more incidents of this kind than are on the indictment, but the court will not involve that in the imposition of sentences.

The consequences of these internet crimes are not necessarily less far-reaching for the children involved than the crimes whereby the suspect had physical contact with his victims. These are always children who were experimenting in their sexual development . In this vulnerable phase they have been deceived by the suspect. Many children have been intimate with a different person than they had wanted. The accused has abused the credulity of these children . It can only be that the children 's confidence in others and their sexual development is disrupted.

In her victim statement, the mother of victim 6 says that her son has a severe form of autism. The contacts with the suspect have spoiled many feelings of victim 6 and have negatively determined his behavior against girls. Victim 6 now has treatment for this. The victim declaration of the parents of victim 8 and victim 7 expresses concern for the future of these brothers and for the way in which they treat each other. They too, as parents, struggle with what happened.

The suspect has explained his actions out of a need for love and tenderness from someone else. However, the court finds it difficult to reconcile this with the clear sexual nature of these contacts. The fact that the suspect repeatedly aimed at portraying sexual acts between two children does not explain the suspect in this way at all.

All in all, it can only be said that the suspect has left a trail of destruction through the lives of sixteen children .

However, the court will impose a lower penalty than these facts justify in themselves. Suspect can only be held partially responsible for what he has done. Moreover, for the protection of society, the treatment of the suspect must be given priority over his punishment.

Reduced imputability

In the opinion of the court of appeal, at the time the proven facts were committed, the accused was less imputable.

The Court of Appeal bases this judgment on the report of psychiatrist HTJ Boerboom and psychologist PG Smits of 25 July 2018. This report is the result of interviews with the accused, an observation at the Pieter Baan Center and an extensive environmental investigation. Smits explained the report at the court session. On this basis, the Court of Appeal finds that the experts have been able to form a complete picture of the suspect. They have gained insight into the disorder that the suspect is suffering from, the way in which that disorder led to the proven facts and the treatment that is necessary to prevent a recurrence of these facts. The Court of Appeal finds that part of the conclusions of the experts are the same as the conclusions of other investigations of suspect.

Smits and Boerboom have established a personality disorder and a sexual disorder with the suspect . The suspect grew up in a family in which he was not accepted by his father and was belittled. Basic emotional needs such as safety and acceptance were missing in his life. To survive this, a mutual dependence with his mother grew . The result of all this was that the suspect could not develop into a person with his own identity and with sufficient autonomy. His sexuality is therefore insufficiently developed. The suspect is unable to make reciprocal contacts. The experts see a rigid pattern of feelings, cognitions and behavior that is anchored in the personality of the suspect. As a diagnosis, the experts have formulated this as follows: another specified personality disorder with evasive, narcissistic and dependent traits and another specified paraphilic disorder.

These disorders are interwoven with the entire functioning of the suspect. From there he made the choices in his life, including the choices in the field of sexuality . The experts assume that due to his personality disorder, the suspect cannot enter into a complex relationship with a man or woman his own age. This made it easier for him to satisfy the need for sex in a situation with children . Due to the disorder, he does not take into account the interests of others if they stand in the way of his satisfaction. The experts therefore advise the suspect to be reduced in imputability.

The court of appeal has no reason to doubt the findings of the experts. Given the substantiation of the conclusions, the court will adopt the experts' advice. The court of appeal deems the accused to be reduced. The disorders described are serious and very decisive for the behavior of the suspect. The Court of Appeal therefore judges that the reduced imputability goes further than somewhat reduced imputability.

The court has imposed a 42-month prison sentence on the suspect. The Advocate General has demanded a prison sentence of 56 months. Due to the degree of reduced imputability, the punishment of the court is lower than demanded. The court will, however, impose a higher penalty than the court, in particular because it values â€‹â€‹the seriousness of the proven facts, with this large number of victims, differently. The court considers a prison sentence of four years, with deduction of custody, appropriate.

The Court of Appeal finds that the reasonable period for trial on appeal has been exceeded. The accused appealed on January 16, 2017. The court ruled more than two years and a month later, while in principle the case should have been settled after sixteen months. The court of appeal considers that this delay is largely explained by the complexity of the case. The complex personality problems of the accused made an investigation at the Pieter Baan Center necessary. This investigation takes time. If, in addition, the reasonable period is exceeded, the court of justice will suffice with the observation of that exceeding.

Imposition of a measure

The next question is how to prevent the accused from committing sexual offenses again . According to the Boerboom and Smits experts, this risk of recurrence is high. The problems with the sexual identity of the suspect are unchanged. The suspect has little or no insight into his personality dynamics and sexuality . The experts therefore consider treatment necessary to prevent recidivism.

Suspect says he wants to be treated. At the court session, the expert Smits stated that he had seen points of view for treatment in his discussions with the suspect. Even if the accused continues to deny some proven facts, according to Smits, treatment will in principle be possible. The suspect's preference is for treatment outside of a clinic. However, the Boerboom and Smits experts consider it necessary that the treatment starts with admission to a clinic. After that, so-called outpatient treatment will be required. The report of the probation service, received on January 15, 2019, shows that this advice is supported by a psychologistVan Schooten. He treated the suspect in the period from October 2016 up to and including July 2018. The expectation of Boerboom and Smits is that the entire treatment will take some time. According to them, a measure of posting may provide sufficient guarantees to shape the clinical treatment.

These conclusions from the experts are also sufficiently substantiated. The court will decide in accordance with this advice. In order to protect society, treatment of the suspect is necessary. Treatment as a special condition for a conditional sentence does not provide sufficient assurance that the treatment will take place. The posting measure does provide that certainty. The court of appeal currently does not consider it necessary for the defendant to be nursed by the government. By setting conditions, the treatment is sufficiently certain. At the same time, these conditions provide sufficient protection for society . In addition to treatment and supervision , the conditions include strict supervisionof the probation service, with control over the internet activities of the suspect, and a prohibition on being alone with minors .

If the accused does not comply with these conditions, the court can still order the nursing from the government. The same can happen if the interests of others' safety or the general safety of others or nursing goods are otherwise required .

In the event that the nursing should still be ordered by the government, the court considers that the accused has been convicted of crimes against or threatening the inviolability of the body of one or more persons.

The provision of posting may therefore last longer than four years in the event of nursing.

In summary, the conditions for the imposition of the posting measure have been met. A reasoned, dated and signed opinion about suspect has been issued by two behavioral experts from different disciplines, including a psychiatrist . The suspect is also convicted for offenses punishable by a prison sentence of four years or more. At the time of the commission of these facts, there was a defective development of his mental capacities in the defendant . Because of the high chance of these facts being repeated and because there is no other appropriate legal framework, the safety of others or the general safetyimposition of the measure on persons or goods. The Court of Appeal took into account both the other advice and reports that were issued about the suspect, and the seriousness of the offenses committed. The suspect has declared himself willing to comply with the conditions to be imposed.

The Court of Appeal realizes that on 1 September 2010, Article 38, third paragraph, of the Criminal Code was amended. Before that date, the judge could impose a maximum of three years in prison in addition to a provision with conditions. On that date this changed to five years. The accused is convicted of offenses committed both before and after 1 September 2010. In the opinion of the court, therefore, in addition to the measure, the prison sentence of four years determined by the court can also be imposed.

The Advocate General has requested that two additional conditions be attached to the posting measure. Firstly, a contact ban with the victims. Secondly, a location ban for the municipality municipality. The contact ban will impose on the court, but the location ban will not. It would be a prohibition for a large area, while the added value of this prohibition in addition to the prohibition of contact with the victims was insufficiently raised.

Provisional detention and immediately enforceable

At the hearing of the court of 29 January 2019 it became clear that on 11 February 2019 the suspect could be included in the name of FPA instead. The suspect's pre-trial detention had lasted almost three years at that time. In principle, a convicted person is eligible for a conditional release after two thirds of his sentence. The defendant has already passed this moment when a four-year prison sentence is imposed. In weighing up the interests, the Court of Appeal therefore took the treatment of the accused on 11 February 2019 more heavily than the interests involved in continuing the pre-trial detention. Moreover, these interests can be done justice by setting conditions.

The Court of Appeal, by separate decision, suspended the suspect's detention on 11 February 2019 or so much later as the suspect arrives in the name of FPA. In addition, virtually the same conditions are set as the conditions attached to the posting measure.

The Court of Appeal will declare the posting immediately enforceable. The reason for this is on the one hand the danger posed by the suspect and on the other hand the possibility to start treatment immediately. Immediately enforceable means that the measure takes effect immediately, even though the accused still has the opportunity to appeal to the Supreme Court of this judgment. Because the measure takes effect immediately, the court of appeal will lift the (now suspended) provisional detention of the suspect.

Claim of the injured party victim 1

The injured party joined the criminal proceedings in the first instance with a claim for compensation. This amounts to â‚¬ 28,470.00, consisting of â‚¬ 18,470.00 in respect of material damage and â‚¬ 10,000.00 in respect of immaterial damage. This claim has been assigned in the judgment whose appeal up to an amount of â‚¬ 23,176.84. The injured party has joined the appeal again for the amount of its original claim.

From the investigation at the hearing, the court found it sufficient that the injured party suffered direct damage up to the amount of â‚¬ 10,000.00 in respect of immaterial damage as a result of the proven actions of the accused under 1.

With regard to the claimed non-material damage, the Court of Appeal considered that the act declared under 1 constitutes a serious infringement of the personal and sexual integrity of the injured party. In view of the nature and the seriousness of this proven act, the nature and the seriousness of the consequences for the injured party and the amounts that Dutch judges tend to allocate in comparable cases, the court considers that the award of â‚¬ 10,000.00 is fair. The accused is obliged to compensate that damage so that the claim will be awarded up to that amount.

For the remainder, namely the material damage claimed, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that the causal link between the alleged damage and the proven actions of the accused has not been sufficiently established without further investigation . This further investigation would result in a disproportionate burden on the criminal proceedings. The injured party can therefore not be received in its claim for this part.

To promote that the damage is compensated by the accused, the court of appeal will impose the measure of article 36f of the Penal Code in the manner mentioned below.

Claim of the injured party victim 2

The investigation at the hearing has sufficiently demonstrated that the injured party suffered direct damage as a result of the defendant's actions as stated under 2. The court values â€‹â€‹this damage at â‚¬ 2,000.00 and considers this as follows.

Acting as proven under 2 results in an infringement of the personal and sexual integrity of the injured party. In view of the nature and seriousness of this proven act, the consequences thereof for the injured party and the amounts that Dutch judges tend to allocate in comparable cases, the court considers that an amount of â‚¬ 2,000.00 is demanded, fair. The accused is obliged to compensate that damage so that the claim will be granted.

To promote that the damage is compensated by the accused, the court of appeal will impose the measure of article 36f of the Penal Code in the manner mentioned below.

Claim of the injured party victim 6

The injured party joined the criminal proceedings in the first instance with a claim for compensation. This amounts to â‚¬ 3,586.16, of which â‚¬ 1,586.16 is classified as material damage and â‚¬ 2,000.00 as non-material damage. The claim is assigned to the judgment from which an appeal has been made.

The investigation at the hearing has sufficiently demonstrated that the injured party has directly suffered non-material damage as a result of the actions of the accused declared under 6 and that the father of the injured party has suffered material damage as a result of this act in his capacity as legal representative .

The court estimates this amount at â‚¬ 3,153.08. The court of appeal hereby takes into account that the defense has acknowledged the basis of this claim and thereby the damage. The accused is obliged to compensate that damage so that the claim will be granted.

The other costs incurred by the father of the injured party in his capacity as legal representative, namely the kilometers driven (â‚¬ 73.08) and the lost income with regard to the attended sessions (â‚¬ 360), a total of â‚¬ 433, 08, the court will classify as legal costs, now that these have been incurred for the benefit of the injured party to explain the claim at the hearing.

To promote that the damage is compensated by the accused, the court of appeal will impose the measure of article 36f of the Penal Code in the manner mentioned below.

Claim of the injured party victim 7

The injured party joined the criminal proceedings in the first instance with a claim for compensation. The claim is assigned to the judgment from which an appeal has been made.

The investigation at the hearing has sufficiently demonstrated that the injured party has directly suffered non-material damage as a result of the actions of the accused declared under 7 and that the parents of the injured party in their capacity as legal representative have suffered material damage as a result of this action .

The Court of Appeal estimates this amount at â‚¬ 3,266.98, consisting of â‚¬ 3,000.00 for non-material damage and â‚¬ 266.98 for material damage. The court of appeal hereby takes into account that the defense has acknowledged the basis of this claim and thereby the damage. The accused is obliged to compensate that damage so that the claim will be granted.

The Court of Appeal will classify the remaining part of the claim, namely â‚¬ 320.15, as legal costs, since these are costs that the parents in their capacity as legal representatives have made for the benefit of the injured party to explain the claim at the hearing. , or in preparation thereof.
