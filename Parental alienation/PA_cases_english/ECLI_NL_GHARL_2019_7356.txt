3.2.
The parties are the parents of the minor , born in 2006 in C.


3.3.
The divorce decree stipulates that the minor has his principal place of residence with the husband and that, with effect from 8 April 2015, the wife has a contribution to the costs of care and upbringing of the minor (also: child support ) € 113 per month and from the day of delivery of the former marital home for child support, € 142 per month will be paid to the man.


3.4.
By order of 21 March 2016, the juvenile court judge placed the minor under the supervision of the certified institution Samen Veilig Midden-Nederland in the Central Netherlands court, location Utrecht (hereinafter: the juvenile court judge ) . The supervision order has subsequently been extended each time, most recently by decision from 8 December 2017 to 21 June 2018.


3.5.
By order of 18 January 2017, the juvenile court granted (urgent) authorization to place the minor away from home with the woman for a period of four weeks. This authorization has subsequently been extended, most recently by decision of 8 December 2017 until 21 June 2018 at the latest.

3.8.
the minor has been living with the woman since 18 January 2017.


4 The scope of the dispute

4.1.
By - the enforceable - decision of 9 May 2018, the court amended the divorce decision of 8 April 2015, set the child support to nil with effect from 9 May 2018, rejected the more or otherwise requested and compensated for the costs of the proceedings.


4.2.
The woman lodged an appeal with two complaints concerning the decision of 9 May 2018. These complaints refer to the effective date of the zeroing of child support . The woman requests the court by order, enforceable in stock, to annul the contested decision and, once again, to amend the divorce decision of 8 April 2015 and to determine that the woman will be effective from 1 April 2017 (at least a date before that date) , which the court judges correctly) is no longer obliged to pay child support to the man, costs legally.


4.3.
The man defends and requests the court, as far as practicable in stock, to reject the request of the woman on appeal, costs in law.


5 The reasons for the decision

5.1.
There is no dispute between the parties that a relevant change of circumstances has occurred within the meaning of Section 1: 401 (1) of the Dutch Civil Code and that child support to be paid by the woman must be set at zero.


5.2.
Parties disagree about the starting date of the zeroing . The man first of all takes the position that the woman cannot, for the first time on appeal, request the child maintenance to be canceled retroactively .


5.3.
The court rules as follows. It is apparent from the documents in the case that in her application at first instance the woman gave reasons why a starting date in the past should be assumed. However, it did not mention a commencement date in the petitum of its request by mistake . On appeal, the woman therefore requested that child support be canceled with retroactive effect .

The appeal also serves to remedy any omissions made in the first instance. The man, who referred in the first instance, was given the opportunity on appeal to respond to the woman's request. This does justice to the principle of the right to be heard and the woman can be received in her request.


5.4.
If the court imposes an alimony obligation, changes it or ends it, it has great freedom in determining the effective date . The - modified - obligation can start on the date that

the circumstances changed,
the counterparty who heard or could have heard of the change,
the introductory document has been submitted or
the decision is pronounced.
Another date is also possible, but the court must in any case be careful with this decision-making freedom if a change with retroactive effect can have far-reaching consequences for the maintenance creditor because it would have to repay what was actually paid or recovered in the preceding period. . This also applies to the court of appeal if it reduces or sets a zero contribution determined or changed in the first instance.


5.5.
Established that the minor as of January 18, 2017 went to live with the woman, the woman until April 1, 2017 to the imposed child support is paid and that the man until July 1, 2017, the allowances received.

The husband states that, even after the minor moved to live with the wife, he continued to pay for the minor . At the hearing on appeal, the man further specified these costs and stated that he had paid the parental contribution of € 50 for the minor , that he had incurred costs for presents and that he continued to pay the minor 's insurance .


5.6.
The court rules as follows.

The costs in the care and upbringing of a child are covered by the contribution of both parents to the costs of the child and the child benefit to be received . In the opinion of the court of appeal, the costs claimed by the man can be covered by the child support he received until 1 April 2017 and the amounts of child allowance received by him until 1 July 2017. The court of expenditure that exceeds these contributions received , in the absence of further substantiation of the costs incurred, not proven. In view of the foregoing and the fact that since (at least) April 1, 2017, the woman has all the costs of the minor has taken responsibility for it, the court sees reason to set the child support to zero from 1 April 2017.


6 The conclusion

6.1.
On the basis of what has been considered above, the court will annul the contested decision and decide as will be stated below.


6.2.
The Court of Appeal will compensate the costs of the proceedings on appeal, now that the parties are former spouses and the proceedings concern the contribution to their child .
