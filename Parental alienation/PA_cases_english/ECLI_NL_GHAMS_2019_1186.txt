Content indication
Co-perpetrating from bottle factory, committed several times, proven proven. Reflections on the claims of the injured parties (affected suppliers). Among other things as a result of defenses about the authority to represent legal persons, the fault of the injured party and requirements that must be made to substantiate the claim in relation to the content of the statements of the suspect. In view of the intensity of the cooperation at the joint and bottle-bottled joints, the Court of Appeal assumes group liability with regard to damage suffered by suppliers. This is followed by reflections on the direct link between the offense and the damage suffered by injured parties. This results in the total or partial allocation of a number of claims. Imposition of the compensation measure not demanded but nevertheless imposed by the court. The Court of Appeal considers that there are insufficient starting points for the opinion that the suspect will not be able to offer any recourse.

What has been charged more or differently under 1 and 2 has not been proven. The suspect must be acquitted of this.

The Court of Appeal bases its conviction that the accused committed the proven statement on the facts and circumstances contained in the means of proof, as they are included in the annex to this judgment.

Evidence

Fact 1: the case 8

Position of the public prosecutor

On the basis of statements by co-suspects, witnesses and tap conversations, the Advocate General has sought to prove the co-perpetration of bottle-pulling by case 8 and co-suspects. The suspect has used a false name, as a result of which he acted as a buyer, project manager, contact person and driver, masking his real identity.

Position of the defense

The defense has pointed out that it cannot be proven that the suspect had the intention of the bottle-draw shop, or that there was talk of co-committing bottle-draw shop. suspect 1 is the only one who has stated that the suspect had knowledge of the bottle-puller. However, in view of all the twists and turns in the file, the pressure on fellow suspects and witnesses and the attempting to produce evidence, there can be no question of a sufficiently reliable witness statement, so that his statements should be excluded from the evidence. Alternatively, those statements can only be used as evidence if they are also based on other means of evidence.

The statement of person J should also be excluded from the evidence, since she was clearly instructed in her statement to limit the role of suspect 1 to a minimum.

The recognitions of the suspect by person K, person M and person N cannot be used for proof in connection with the unreliable realization of the recognitions. There has been either a repeated investigation confrontation where only a single photo has been added, or a single person confrontation. Both modalities provide an extremely suggestive situation. Furthermore, the decisive value cannot be attributed to the recognition.

In case the court uses one or more recognitions by person K, person M or person N for the evidence, the defense requests that person M, person N and person L hear as witnesses. person M should be heard about his recognition of the suspect in second instance, person N about the manner of introduction to case 8, about what was discussed and about the agreement concluded with case 8 and person L about the way the suspect was introduced, whereby the testimony of this witness could also serve to further test the value of the recognition by person K.In the alternative, the defense made the conditional request to hear person O as a witness. To that end, it has been argued that person O was the person who discussed the substance of case 8 with the suspect and can confirm that the suspect was indeed assuming that his work was for his own account. The defense considers the hearing of this witness necessary in view of the defenses made by the defense with regard to the intent of the suspect and the co-perpetrating.

The judgment of the court

With regard to the defense seeking to exclude evidence from the statements of suspect 1, the Court of Appeal considered as follows.

On January 21, 2016, suspect 1, after not having explained much, drafted a written statement that is in the file. In it he stated that he had initially started to participate in the management of the first companies without criminal intentions, but that this was later changed, under the influence of his father.and co-suspect suspect 2. Soon a practice had arisen of companies with a short life cycle in which the core of business operations consisted of ordering goods without paying for them. Suspect 1 briefly described the course of events per company. He has charged himself and the other parties involved. As a witness, heard by the examining magistrate on 30 June 2016, suspect 1 stated further. He said that all involved were aware of the fact that they were so-called "thuds". This also applies to the suspect; this became involved at a given moment in case 8, where the suspect was one of the buyers. Together with person O, the suspect received 32.5% of the profit. As a motive for giving "opening things,"

The defense has pointed to putting fellow suspects and witnesses under pressure and trying to fabricate evidence. The Court of Appeal understands that the defense has an eye on the eavesdropping and recorded telephone conversations between suspect 1 and his father , the co-suspect suspect 3, during the first months that suspect 1 was detained. In these conversations, the current investigation is apparently being discussed. In the investigationSubjects involved are discussed, whether or not based on a nickname. More specifically, it concerns the interrogations that will be taken from them and the expected content of their statements. From the conversations it can be deduced that suspect 1 tries to take control and says what each of them must explain, apparently with the aim of limiting the damage for him, suspect 1. To that end it is agreed that his father , among otherssome of them have visited or are going to visit. Suspect 1 speaks about the desired content of their statements in terms such that those involved "just have to be honest" and "just have to tell the truth". And with regard to suspect 2, it appears that suspect 1 wants him to "keep his mouth shut". From the content of the conversations it can further be concluded that person F, the partner of suspect 1, and suspect 3 each visit suspect 2 once. This in an attempt to induce suspect 2 to declare that he had nothing to do with it and does not know what the role of suspect 1 was.

In retrospect, based on the statements of suspect 1 himself but also those of suspect 2, it is evident that the honesty and truth that suspect 1 spoke about in these conversations did not have the meaning they have in the usual language. suspect 1 wanted to manipulate those involved and to keep control over what would be declared by co-suspects for the benefit of his interests in his own criminal case.

In this course of action, however, there is insufficient ground to assume that the statements made later by suspect 1 are unreliable and cannot be used for the evidence. Viewed in the light of his later statements, in which he also entrusts himself, it can be concluded that the truthfulness of what was shared in the tap conversations is very low. Moreover, it is clear that suspect 1 spoke with his father in a context that he considered confidential. It does not concern statements made which he later fully or partially returned to. Also in that respect there is no reason to conclude that the telephone conversations between suspect 1 and his father disqualify his later statementsas useful means of proof. In addition, the wish expressed by suspect 1 that suspect 2 will keep his mouth shut fits in with the context of the confessional statements later made by suspect 2 in which suspect 1 is also charged.

The statements of suspect 1 are furthermore confirmed in the file. In general, the procedure as followed in the different companies is confirmed in the statements of the defendant 2. The declarations of suspect 1 fit in with many relevant details in the declarations or declarations of injured suppliers and the declarations made by the bankruptcy trustees involved in the various bankruptcieshave been taken. Anchoring is also provided by numerous documents in the file showing the method described by the defendant 1 in which invoices had to give a distorted picture of the course of affairs when goods are delivered to customers. Many notes contain the comment that one part is paid in cash and another part will be paid by bank. According to suspect 1, the latter did not take place.

On the basis of all of the foregoing, the conclusion must be that the statements of suspect 1 that he has made before the examining magistrate and the aforementioned written statement, even where they are burdensome for the suspect, can be used for the evidence. The statements of the suspect himself also offer no clues to assume that the suspect 1 has or may have had motives for taxing the suspect on incorrect grounds.

The defense seeking to exclude the evidence from the statement of person J needs no discussion, since the court will not use this statement for the evidence.

The defense has further argued that recognitions of the suspect by person K, person M and person N cannot be used for evidence in connection with the unreliable realization of the recognitions. To that end, the lawyer has essentially repeated what he has already submitted in support of the witness requests from person M, person L and person N at the hearing on 25 February 2019.

As the Court of Appeal considered at the hearing of 28 February 2019 in the context of the aforementioned requests for witnesses, there was, according to the communication of the Advocate General at the hearing at the time of the first contact of the FIOD with the witnesses on 7 January 2015 and 6 November respectively 2014 (at the hearing on 28 February 2019, the court mistakenly named the date 5 November 2014) no photo of the suspect is available yet. He was not in the picture as a suspect. Given the date of arrest of the suspect suspect 6, namely on 3 June 2015 and the dates of the further interviews of the witnesses mentioned in May 2015, this communication is plausible. In that regard, the requests made on 25 February 2019 therefore lacked a factual basis.

It has also been stated that there is either a repeated investigation confrontation or a one-person confrontation, while according to the lawyer both situations result in an extremely suggestive situation. Counsel has interpreted these confrontations as a so-called "verification confrontation".

The Court of Appeal considered that the recognition of person M will not be used for the evidence, so that the defense does not need a discussion to that extent.

Furthermore, the Court of Appeal is considering, with regard to the characterization to be given to the photo-confrontation referred to here, that it cannot generally be said that the evidence from a photo-confrontation in the context of investigation is unreliable and cannot be regarded as proof. Different elements play a role in recognition. One of the factors that can positively influence the reliability of a recognition is the degree of familiarity with the observed person. The more people have an image of the person involved, the less visual information is required for reliable recognition. In addition, the knowledge based on external characteristics is more valuable if it originated and formed during meetings in person than if it came from a photo or other images.

In summary, this means that the probative value and the probative value of the recognitions must be assessed in the light of their realization and viewed in conjunction with the other available evidence.

Against this background, contrary to what the counsel has advocated, the court considers the recognition of the suspect by person K and person N reliable and will use these recognitions as evidence. The court considers the following as follows.

The file shows that person K and person N have had personal contact with name F. person K stated that he had been in case 8 on 26 September 2014. There he spoke with name F and he did business with him. person K stated to have spoken with name F for about half an hour to 45 minutes.

person N has stated to the reporters that he has seen name F twice at the office address of case 8 Both times he was received by name F, once for delivery and once with placing a coffee machine.

Both person K and person N, before being confronted with the photo of the suspect whom they subsequently designated as the name F they were talking about, provided a specific and distinctive personal characteristics containing a description of name F.

In view of what has just been noted with regard to the meetings of person K and person N, in combination with the description of that name F by person K and person N preceding the recognition, the Court of Appeal considers what the counsel has argued with regard to the recognitions insufficient to doubt the reliability of those identifications. The Court of Appeal has in no way shown that the manner in which the photo of the suspect was shown to person K and person N resulted in an "extremely suggestive situation", as stated by the counsel .

In addition, the recognitions are supported by the following means of evidence.

In his written statement of January 21, 2016, suspect 1 stated that the suspect used the name F in name of purchaser 8. Co-suspect suspect 5 also recognizes suspect 5 in photo F-023 as name F, a person who sat behind a desk in case 8. Furthermore, the co-suspect suspect 2 stated that the orders in case 8 were placed by himself, suspect 5 and the suspect.

The Court of Appeal draws the conclusion from the foregoing that the suspect used the false name F in case 8 and, together with suspect 2 and suspect 5, engaged in the purchase of goods that were not paid for.

In view of the above, the defense of the counsel is rejected.

The conditional request by the defense for the hearing of person M is rejected, since the condition, namely the use of recognition as evidence, has not come into effect. The conditional requests for the hearing of person N and person L are rejected, since the Court of Appeal, considering the substantiation on which those requests are based, viewed in the light of the foregoing considerations regarding the reliability of the recognitions, the necessity not present eight.

The question then is whether the suspect had the intention at the bottle factory. The Court of Appeal is considering the following.

The evidence shows that case 8 was declared bankrupt on January 6, 2015. Many suppliers were disadvantaged in the period from 27 August 2014 to 30 November 2014, for a total amount of more than 550,000 euros. Case 8 uses false names. The purchases were made by suspect 5 (alias name D), suspect 2 (alias name C) and the suspect (alias name F). The purchased and unpaid goods were then sold for 35 to 40% of the purchase value to a number of regular customers by suspect 1 and the goods were transported to those customers by suspect 4 and suspect 3. The suspect reported in the profit.

The evidence shows that the suspect was one of the persons in particular charged with the purchase of goods for case 8. He has been directly involved with various deliveries mentioned in the indictment for which no payment has been made. In addition, the suspect knew that some of his co-suspects were purchasing goods with similar intentions.

The Court of Appeal concludes from the above that the suspect together with his fellow suspects had the intention of buying goods without payment. After all, there is a period of more than 3 months, in which goods have been purchased on a very large scale from a large number of buyers, by buyers who used a false name. The statements of suspect 2 and suspect 1 show that false names were used as part of this large-scale bottle-puller, while the suspect did not state anything against it. In addition, any records kept by the suspect and / or his co-suspects for the purpose of purchasing have not been found to exist and there are no documents showing a regular employment or other business position or relationship of the suspect in case 8. These circumstances cannot be interpreted differently than that the suspect - as was also stated by the suspect 1 with regard to all participants in the various companies that appear in the file - knew the hat and the brim. On the basis of the foregoing, the Court of Appeal considers that it has been proven that, together with suspect 2, suspect 1 and suspect 5, the suspect was guilty of bottle-pulling in the context of case 8.

The court of appeal rejects the conditional request to hear person O as a witness. The Court of Appeal does not consider the necessity for this to be present, because it considers itself sufficiently informed with regard to the subjects on which the defense wished to question the witness, as is apparent from the above.

Fact 2: the case 11 case

Position of the public prosecutor

With reference to the prosecutor's first instance claim and to the statement of the witness P, who was heard at the court hearing, the Advocate General has concluded that the court must understand that he is a co-perpetrator. In the opinion of the Advocate General, the recognition of the suspect by witnesses is an important part of the evidence.

Position of the defense

The defense counsel has argued that the suspect has never used the name name G and has never used the e-mail address of case 11 with this name. Nor can this conclusion be drawn from the witness's statement P. In the defense's opinion, the statement of person P is unreliable in essential respects and cannot be used as evidence on those points. Reference was made to the statement such as the person P who witnessed as a witness at the hearing, from which it would appear that the witness was unable to answer practically all the questions that specifically related to business operations.

The statements of person Q and person R as made with the FIOD are also unreliable and cannot be used for proof. Their statements to the examining magistrate must be assessed with the necessary reserves. To that end, it has been argued that in view of the answers given in the FIOD interrogations, it cannot be otherwise than during the interrogations, countless questions were asked that were not verbalized. An interrogator often tries to get an answer from a suspect with follow-up questions. There is therefore steering. Also from the statements of person Q and person R it cannot be concluded that the suspect used a different name, had the role assigned to him by person R in the FIOD, nor was he the person who had the name name H assigned to person Q. On the basis of the file, it seems that the FIOD had the opinion that person R would be the cat catcher and person Q a simple employee, with person S and the suspect being the ones who had the malicious intent. This was then woven into the interrogations and can no longer be checked. There may also have been reasons for person Q and person R - as former suspects - to confirm the FIOD's way of thinking.

Furthermore, it has been stated in a concise manner that the evidence does not show that the suspect had a more extensive involvement than follows from his own statement. He had no intention of bottling, nor was there any evidence of close and conscious cooperation between Westerhoek and the suspect regarding the intention to buy goods without paying, according to the counsel .

In the event that the court comes to a statement of evidence, the defense requests that person O be heard as a witness, now that the witness can declare relevant about the first plan of case 11, the division of tasks that subsequently arose, the further withdrawal by the suspect, what was discussed about outstanding accounts and what the role of the suspect ultimately was.

The judgment of the court

On 10 June 2015, the witness P made a statement to investigators of the FIOD about case 11. In business terms, he stated that he had been at the business address of case 11 about twelve times, where he spoke inter alia with the first name of suspect 6 and the first name of person S. They wanted the company to move quicklyfrom the outset, accepted a quotation from person P regarding, among other things, the design of workplaces, the construction of a website, the delivery and management of software and the delivery of a television. Due to call sign suspect 6, payments were made to person P. person P has explained in detail about the nature and extent of his work for case 11, the layout of the business premises of case 11 and the people he saw at work in that building.

Regarding caller name suspect 6, person P stated that, after case 11 was in default with regard to payments, he heard that caller name suspect 6 actually had suspect 6 as last name, and that on the internet he saw the telephone number ending in -508 at the name suspect 6, that was also the telephone number that person P had received as the telephone number of name G. Person P also heard from the accused's name 6 that he had been operated on in connection with an aneurysm and that he had a 9-year-old son, which data - as determined by the court - corresponded to the data provided by the suspect in his FIOD dd Declaration of personal circumstances made on 3 June 2015. Person P was shown 28 photos during this interrogation. In the photo with number F-023, person P recognized the call sign suspect 6 about which he spoke in his statement. Photo F-023 concerns the photo of the suspect.

Person P was heard as a witness at the hearing on appeal. The counselorhas stated that the hearing of witnesses at the court hearing revealed that the witness was not strong in his memory. For example, the witness did not remember whether there were still contacts or discussions between the first meeting and the offer when he first visited the business address of case 11, what work had taken place before the invoice for the benefit of the down payment was sent on January 7, 2014, who was present at a presentation on January 30, 2014, with whom he discussed the content and operation of the website, who said how many computers should come and to whom he explained how the equipment worked in the presentation room.

The Court of Appeal found that at the hearing at the Court of Appeal, the witness explained at length to questions from the Court, the Advocate General and the defense about facts and circumstances that took place more than 5 years earlier. He was very specific and detailed about, among other things, the way in which he was in contact with case 11, with whom he maintained contacts there and to which subjects that related, how often he visited case 11, who was present there at the time and to what saw his work for case 11. The witness was certainly in his confirmation of the recognition of the suspect as name G made at the FIOD.

Needless to say, over the years there will always be questions to which a witness must remain answerable. This is all the more true if those questions do not directly relate to the substance of his earlier statement, as is the case here. The mere circumstance that the witness was unable to answer a number of questions does not, in the opinion of the Court of Appeal, imply that the witness's statements should for that reason be judged to be unreliable, all the more so now that the witness is not only concerned with the substance of his statements, including on the role of the suspect in case 11 and the recognition of the suspect as name G, but also with regard to other details, as shown above, is consistent.

The defense is rejected.

The defense that the statements of person R and person Q should be deemed unreliable is also rejected. The Court of Appeal understands that the defense is concerned with the statement of witness Q of June 22, 2015 and the statement of person R of June 4, 2015. The Court of Appeal has in no way shown that the FIOD had been directed towards respect of those interrogations. That the hearings, as represented in the official reports drawn up on the official promise, are not expressed in a question and answer form, are not elaborated verbatim and / or are of too long a nature, does not in any way point in that direction. Counsel 's statementthat person Q and person R as former suspects may have had reasons to confirm a line of thought of the FIOD contains several suggestions. The file does not in any way provide starting points that could support such suggestions.

From the aforementioned statements by person P and person Q it follows that the suspect called himself in name 11 name G. He gave person Q, who also carried out work for case 11, the false name name H. The suspect played an active and guiding role at this company , had contacts with suppliers and often arranged contact with the drivers who came to collect and deliver the delivered goods.

That the suspect placed orders with suppliers is further confirmed by the statement of person T from supplier TT. person T has further stated that the suspect, among others, was in charge of the daily management of case 11.

case 11 was registered on 1 September 2014 as a dissolved legal person that ceased to exist, because there were no longer any known benefits from 14 July 2014. In the period from 21 January 2014 up to and including 25 August 2014, a large number of suppliers for a total of more than € 250,000 worth of goods ordered by and delivered to case 11. These goods are not paid.

The Court of Appeal concludes from the above that the suspect together with his fellow suspects had the intention of buying goods without payment. There is a period of more than seven months, in which goods have been purchased on a very large scale from a large number of buyers, by buyers who used a false name. The suspect played an active, steering and managerial role at (the start of) this enterprise and also gave another person a false name. Of any records kept by the suspect and / or his co-suspects for the purpose of purchasing and / or sellinghas not been found. Furthermore, there are no documents showing a regular employment of the suspect or a different business relationship with case 11. These facts and circumstances cannot be interpreted differently than that the suspect knew about the large-scale bottle-hauling. On the basis of the above, the Court of Appeal considers that it has been proven that the suspect, together with at least person S, is guilty of bottling.

The court of appeal rejects the conditional request to hear person O as a witness. The Court of Appeal does not consider the necessity for this to be present, because it considers itself sufficiently informed with regard to the subjects on which the defense wished to question the witness, as is apparent from the above.

Punishability of the proven

No circumstance has become plausible that excludes the punishability of the proven proven under 1 and 2, so that this is punishable.

The certified proven under 1 and 2 always yields:

making a habit of buying goods for the purpose of securing access to those goods for another person or without payment in full.

Punishability of the suspect

No circumstance has become plausible that excludes the suspect's punishability with regard to the evidence proven under 1 and 2, so that the suspect is punishable.

Imposition of punishment

The Amsterdam District Court sentenced the accused for the proven first instance under 1 and 2 to a prison term of 18 months, of which 4 months conditional, with a probationary period of 2 years. Furthermore, decisions have been taken regarding the claims of the injured parties, as further described in the judgment for which an appeal has been described.

The Advocate General has requested that the suspect be sentenced to the same sentence as imposed by the court of first instance.

On appeal, the Court of Appeal determined the punishment to be imposed on the basis of the seriousness of the facts and the circumstances in which they were committed and in view of the person of the suspect. The Court of Appeal in particular took the following into consideration.

The suspect has been guilty of multiple co-perpetrations of bottle-pulling. The suspect and his accomplices used before the companies business case 11 and 8. These companies were presented to the outside world as successful, bona fide companies. To this end, business premises were taken into use, which were subsequently equipped for both equipment and personnel. The digital infrastructure was also provided. The suspect and his co-perpetrators have approached unsuspecting entrepreneurs using false names in order to order goods on a very large scale, often for tens of thousands of euros at a time. The total damage runs into the many hundreds of thousands of euros.

The role of the suspect consisted in particular of purchasing goods and concluding agreements with regard to services to be performed. The suspect has thus had an important position in the whole, which, in addition to the extent of the damage, also counts as an aggravating factor in determining the sentence to be imposed.

From the extract from the Judicial Documentation of 11 February 2019 in the name of the suspect, it follows that the suspect was previously irrevocably sentenced to custodial sentences for various crimes. The Court of Appeal also has that recidivism to the disadvantage of the suspect taken into account when determining the penalty.

The defense advocated imposing a work sentence on the suspect, combined with a suspended prison sentence. Reference was made to the age and fragile health of the suspect, his limited role in the whole course of time in this case.

The Court of Appeal sees no reason to deviate from the punishment modality referred to by the Advocate General, in the opinion of the Court the nature and seriousness of the present facts, also in view of the large number of injured parties and the amount of the total amount of damages. , no other option than to allow the imposition of a (partially) unconditional prison sentence.

Taking all of the above into account, the court considers a prison sentence of twelve months, of which 4 months conditionally, with a probationary period of three years, is appropriate.

The Court of Appeal finds that the reasonable period as referred to in Article 6, paragraph 1 of the European Convention for Protectionof Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) has been exceeded. The starting point in this case is that the hearing must be concluded with a final judgment within two years after an appeal has been lodged, unless there are special circumstances, such as the complexity of a case, the influence of the suspect and / or or his counsel on the procedure and the way in which the case has been handled by the competent authorities. The Court of Appeal has not proved such special circumstances. With regard to the procedure on appeal, the suspect filed an appeal on 1 December 2016. The court of appeal pronounces judgment on 5 April 2019. The Court of Appeal is of the opinion that, given the course of the proceedings, the reasonable period has been exceeded by approximately four months. Because of this slight exceedance, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that it is sufficient to simply state that an infringement of Art. 6, first paragraph, ECHR.

Taking all things into account, the Court of Appeal considers that a partially conditional prison sentence of a specified duration is appropriate and appropriate.

Claims from the injured parties

General considerations

Content file

The lawyer has primarily taken the position that, in view of the requested acquittal for fact 2, the injured parties must be declared inadmissible in their claims. In the alternative, it has been argued that there is too much uncertainty as to what claims are being made and that the injured parties should face the same fate on that basis.

Now that the subsidiary point of view concerns, by nature and content, a question that precedes and extends beyond what has been put forward as a primary point of view, the court will first discuss what has been put forward in the alternative.

The defense raises the question of how the case file is composed with regard to the claimant's claim.

The Court of Appeal establishes the following in that regard. In the file, all claims for the injured party are added by the public prosecutor. In the case of damage allegedly caused by persons involved in case 11, it concerns twelve claims. In addition, the documents include a document "OM position regarding the claims of the injured party" of 26 August 2016. This was submitted during the investigationat the hearing at first instance for the debate on the large number of claims and the result to be attached to this by the court. This document states that the claims relating to case 11 are deemed to have been filed in the case against the suspect suspect 6. According to the official report of the hearing on 5 October 2016, the court has allinjured parties manifestly inadmissible with application of Article 333 Sv. On this basis, it can be assumed that twelve claims were initially raised and that there are no grounds for doubt. At the hearing on 5 October 2016, the public prosecutor announced that there were four claims, but the origin of this number has not been explained. The communication was also of no significance in the remainder of the procedure.

With this state of affairs, the Court of Appeal assumes that twelve claims were pending in the first instance. On appeal, six injured parties have maintained their claims. These are pending. There is no basis for declaring inadmissibility.

General

In pleading, the defense with regard to the claims of the injured parties put forward a number of general views in defense and made requests. In addition, positions have been taken at the level of individual claims that have regularly returned. The court will first respond to these views and requests in the following.

Representative authority

On behalf of the suspect, it has been stated that various claims filed on behalf of legal persons suffer from formal defects. In many cases, it would not be clear whether the claim was filed and signed by a person who is authorized to represent the legal person.

First of all, it must be assumed that the case law has previously accepted that a challenge to the authority of the person representing an injured legal person in criminal proceedings may be subject to specific requirements. If the documents in the file show sufficient coherence and continuity in acting on behalf of the legal person and when signing documents (such as invoices, correspondence, e-mail messages, the so-called wish form in first and second instance), the contesting of the authority must sufficiently substituted. In a few cases, the Court of Appeal, based on a defense to that effect, will come to the conclusion that too many questions have been raised about the authority to represent (in the legal form or on the basis of a power of attorney) and that the injured party is already inadmissible on that ground. party to the claim. In those cases where the court does receive the injured party in the claim, the power to represent it has been soundly justified, at least in the light of the no more than bare dispute, has proved sufficient.

Delivery not demonstrated

With regard to various claims, the defense has taken the position that the alleged delivery of the goods has not been sufficiently substantiated. With regard to a number of claims, the counsel has chosen the wording that the delivery is disputed. In no case does the court of appeal consider that there is a reasoned dispute. In addition, with regard to none of the claims on behalf of the suspect it has been argued that no purchase agreement had been concluded with the injured party.

In this regard, the Court of Appeal, more specifically with regard to fact 1, involves the statements made by the suspects suspect 1 and suspect 2 during the investigation. These entail that the companies they operatedid not allow themselves to be typified by orderly and structured business operations and that when ordering goods the intention was always not to pay after the agreed delivery. Seen in that light, it may be objectively judged that the suspect has given an alternative reading of the alleged facts with regard to the claims in question, which requires one or more of the injured parties to be obliged to provide further evidence. To that extent, there is no reason to consider the claims of the injured parties insufficiently substantiated.

Insurance benefits

In some cases, the defense pointed out that the injured party has received a benefit under a (credit) insurance policy, but that the amount of that benefit raises questions. It has never come any further than suggesting it.

The Court of Appeal finds that in a number of claims a payment received from the insurance company has been deducted from the claim amount. A further discussion of what has been submitted is not necessary.

VAT

With the Advocate General and the defense, and in line with consistent case law, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that the claimed VAT is not always eligible for allocation. It must be taken into account that this claimed claim is eligible for settlement on the basis of Article 29 of the Turnover Tax Act . In addition, the injured party is under the obligation to limit damage pursuant to Section 6: 101 of the Dutch Civil Code. Now that, despite the above legal principles, VAT has been claimed by various injured parties without further explanation, the claims must be regarded as insufficiently substantiated, so that the injured parties must be declared inadmissible in that regard.

Direct connection

The Court of Appeal has declared proven under 1 and 2 that the suspect has been guilty of co-perpetrating bottle-pulling, in the context of the business operations of case 8 and case 11 respectively.

In the key to the evidence for fact 1, the Court of Appeal has already considered that the suspect need not have been directly involved in every purchase or purchase in order to explain the co-perpetration of bottle-pulling in this case. However, the suspect's contribution to the purchasing process has been so substantial that, even if it is assumed that he has not been directly involved in every order or delivery, he can be regarded as co-perpetrator of the bottle-puller in the size as charged. The Court of Appeal has devoted similar considerations to the evidence for fact 2, the co-perpetration of bottle-pulling in the context of case 11.

With regard to both facts, the Court of Appeal considered that the evidence shows that the suspect had an active role in committing bottle-pulling. He was involved in ordering goods, his co-perpetrators were also involved in this and there was a shared common intention not to pay for the goods ordered after delivery. The Court of Appeal considers the intensity of this criminal cooperation such that there is question of group liability as referred to in Article 6: 166 of the Dutch Civil Code. This provision provides for individual liability of persons (participants) belonging to a group for damage caused unlawfully by the group. The degree of involvement of the individual participants in the unlawful act is unimportant. This individual liability is justified by everyone's contribution to creating the chance that such damage would occur. It finds its limits in the requirement that the likelihood of causing damage in such a way should have prevented them from conducting them in groups. In this case, however, the suspect knew or should have known that the group action created the chance of the damage suffered by each concrete injured party.

The foregoing leads to the conclusion that the two proven facts prove to be directly related to the damage suffered. Also to the extent that, if and insofar as the other conditions for granting the claims are met, there is no impediment to an allocation decision on the claims.

Damage compensation measure and replacement custody

On behalf of the suspect, it was requested not to impose the compensation measure, or at least not to impose the related replacement detention. Referring to the fact that he did not request that the measure be imposed, the Advocate General supported this request. The court considers as follows.

Pursuant to the second paragraph of Article 36f of the Criminal Code, the judge can impose the measure if and insofar as the suspect is liable to the victim under civil law for the damage caused by the offense. Only in exceptional cases is the imposition of the measure not eligible. Now that the Advocate General has not requested the imposition of the measure, the Court of Appeal is faced with the question of whether it will ex officio proceed with the imposition.

The court is only then required to state the reasons why a position that the compensation measure should not be imposed is deviated from if a position makes it sufficiently clear that the case is exceptional. In this context, the defense has argued that the suspect is missing and that there will also be no capacity to pay in the future . In addition, reference was made to his advanced age, family situation and vulnerable health.

The Court of Appeal considered that on the basis of the activities of the suspect, as evidenced by the evidence, it cannot be excluded that he has earned substantial sums of money during the foster period of Facts 1 and 2. As a result of his attitude, no further insight was obtained. On the basis of the available summary financial information, it cannot yet be judged that the suspect will not be able to offer any recourse. For that reason, there is insufficient reason to judge that such an exceptional situation exists that the imposition of the compensation measure must be dispensed with. The same applies to the replacement custody. The fact that the measure has not been advanced does not change this.
