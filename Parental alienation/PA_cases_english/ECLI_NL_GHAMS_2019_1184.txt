The Court of Appeal bases its conviction that the accused committed the proven statement on the facts and circumstances contained in the means of proof, as they are included in the annex to this judgment.

Evidence

Fact 1

Under 1, the suspect was charged with participation in a criminal organization. The aim of the organization would be to commit bottle trafficking and bankruptcy fraud. The members of the organization were alleged to have worked as a method of operating a company for a number of months in which goods were purchased on a large scale. After that usually a bankruptcy followed and the recovery options of creditors were deliberately hampered, among other things by the use of catcatchers.

Position of the Advocate General

The Advocate General argued that the suspect's participation consisted of the suspect transporting the purchased goods from the victimized suppliers to a storage location and / or to customers. Furthermore, the suspect of one of the legal persons, namely case 13, would have been a director for some time.

Position of the defense

The suspect has denied his criminal involvement. On behalf of him, his counsel argued that he had no knowledge that the goods were not paid. Nor did he know that his registration as a director of that company had a criminal purpose. That is why he should be acquitted of fact 1, according to the counselor .

Judgment of the court

The court considers as follows.

The co-suspect suspect 1 has declared incriminating about those involved in the different companies, including the suspect. In the opinion of the counselor , these statements cannot be used as evidence because they are unreliable.

suspect 1, after not having explained much at first, prepared a written statement on January 21, 2016, which is in the file. In it he stated that he had initially started to participate in the management of the first companies without criminal intentions, but that this was later changed, under the influence of his father.and co-suspect suspect 2. Soon a practice had arisen of companies with a short life cycle in which the core of business operations consisted of ordering goods without paying for them. Suspect 1 briefly described the course of events per company. He has charged himself and the other parties involved. As a witness, heard by the examining magistrate on 30 June 2016, suspect 1 stated further. He said that all involved were aware of the fact that they were so-called "thuds". This also applies to the suspect; he had known what the approach was for years. As a motive for giving “opening of cases”, suspect 1 mentions the fact that the other suspects tried to blame him.

The defense pointed to the eavesdropping and recorded telephone conversations between suspect 1 and his father , the co-suspect suspect 3, during the first months that suspect 1 was detained. In these conversations, the current investigation is apparently being discussed. Subjects involved in the research are discussed, whether or not based on a nickname. More specifically, it concerns the interrogations that will be taken from them and the expected content of their statements. From the conversations it can be deduced that suspect 1 tries to take control and says what each of them must explain, apparently with the aim of limiting the damage for him, suspect 1. To that end, it has been agreed that these arefather has visited some of them or is going to visit. Suspect 1 speaks about the desired content of their statements in terms such that those involved "just have to be honest" and "just have to tell the truth". And regarding suspect 2, it appears that suspect 1 wants him to "keep his mouth shut". From the content of the conversations it can further be concluded that person F, the partner of suspect 1, and suspect 3 each visit the suspect once. This in an attempt to induce suspect 2 to declare that he had nothing to do with it and does not know what the role of suspect 1 was.

In retrospect, based on the statements of suspect 1 himself but also those of suspect 2, it is evident that the honesty and truth that suspect 1 spoke about in these conversations did not have the meaning they have in the usual language. suspect 1 wanted to manipulate those involved and to control what would be declared by co-suspects for the benefit of his interests in his own criminal case.

However, there is insufficient ground in this course of action to assume that the later will continue

statements made by the suspect 1 are unreliable and cannot be used for the evidence. Viewed in the light of his later statements, in which he also entrusts himself, it can be concluded that the truthfulness of what was shared in the tap conversations is very low. Moreover, it is clear that suspect 1 spoke with his father in a context that he considered confidential. It does not concern statements made which he later fully or partially returned to. Also in that respect there is no reason to conclude that the telephone conversations between suspect 1 and his father disqualify his later statementsas useful means of proof. In addition, the wish expressed by suspect 1 that suspect 2 will keep his mouth shut fits in with the context of the confessional statements later made by suspect 2, in which suspect 1 is also charged.

The statements of suspect 1 are furthermore confirmed in the file. In general, the procedure as followed in the different companies is confirmed in the statements of the defendant 2. The declarations of suspect 1 fit in with many relevant details in the declarations or declarations of injured suppliers and the declarations made by the bankruptcy trustees involved in the various bankruptcieshave been taken. Anchoring is also provided by numerous documents in the file showing the method described by the defendant 1 in which invoices had to give a distorted picture of the course of affairs when goods are delivered to customers. Many notes contain the comment that one part is paid in cash and another part will be paid by bank. According to suspect 1, the latter did not take place.

On the basis of all of the foregoing, the conclusion must be that the statements of suspect 1 that he has made before the examining magistrate and the aforementioned written statement, even where they are burdensome for the suspect, can be used for the evidence. The statements of the suspect himself also offer no clues to assume that the suspect 1 has or may have had motives for taxing the suspect on incorrect grounds.

In addition to the content of the statements made by the accused 1, the Court of Appeal considers the following facts and circumstances, as evidenced by the content of the evidence, to be reason for proving the knowledge of the accused about the intention of the criminal organization and its intention to participate to that.

The suspect was a partner in the company case 13. This was established on 1 May 2012. He received 300 euros from his father for his cooperation by registering as a director. On January 8, 2013, case 13, but also the suspect in person as a result of his involvement in this company , were declared bankrupt. Many suppliers who had delivered goods in the period 25 May 2012 up to and including 31 July 2012 were not paid. The scale of the disadvantage was around 3.5 tonnes. The suspect was also involved in this undertaking in a practical sense, also according to his own statements .

suspect 2 stated that he had assigned the name A to the suspect and perhaps approached companies with the name A. After hearing as a witness at the hearing on appeal on 21 February 2019, suspect 2 returned to this. The Court of Appeal does not see this as a reason not to start from the statement that Defendant 2 has made about this at the FIOD. The latter statement is detailed and provided with context, such as the statement that the false name was related to the previous conviction of the suspect for drug offenses.

False names were also used by others in company 13, including suspect 1 who called himself B junior and suspect 3 who used the name B senior. In his statement of 28 May 2015, the suspect stated that it was possible that suspect 1 used this name at the time. The name name B was also used by suspect 1 at the company case 14, for which company the suspect performed driver duties. The same applies to company 15, for which company transported the suspect goods. The council womanhas pointed out that the latter finding is based solely on the statement of the defendant 2, but contrary to what he has argued, there is no reason to derive from the right to prove that the defendant has not been proven to have been driving for this company . False names were also used at company case 8. suspect 2 called himself name C against suppliers. The suspect must have known this because on 21 October 2014 he collected goods from the supplier supplier 1. The name name C was stated on the collection ticket. suspect 5 was name D.

The means of proof also mean that the companies used by the co-suspects to buy goods without paying for them were only operational for a few months at a time. The suspect knew that too. A multitude of goods were purchased and resold. It concerned meat, camping supplies, household appliances, lighting equipment, electronics, and so on. The name of the suspect is mentioned several times on notes from the suppliers of case 13.

The suspect himself stated during his interrogation at the FIOD that he regularly transported goods within the framework of the various companies. From the statement of suspect 2, made at a time when he even stated with restraint about the bottle-puller and the fraud, it can be concluded that, for example, in case 9 it was essentially a collaboration of four people, including the suspect.

The court also considers the statement of the witness G who had spoken with the suspect during the period that he worked for case 5 to be significant. The suspect would have told her that the company was engaged in supplying pasar malams. None of this has been proven. The suspect apparently wanted to disguise the nature of business operations towards her.

It is against the background of this combination of relevant facts and circumstances, viewed in the light of the statements made by the accused 1, that it can be assumed that the accused was not aware of the actual nature of the activities of the companies in which he played a role. The suspect worked in an environment where the use of fake names was common and companiesregularly ended up in bankruptcy. The suspect himself also went bankrupt on January 8, 2013, but, as he stated, he let himself be convinced by those directly involved (suspect 2 and suspect 1) that fair action would be taken thereafter. In view of the constantly changing nature of the merchandise, this is completely unbelievable. This judgment also contributes to the fact that the suspect received a sum of money after he had registered as a director. It is also significant that the suspect received false pay slips from suspect 1 for December 2013 and January and February 2014 while he was aware of that forgery. In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, the suspect was aware of the bottle-puller, committed during the period included in the indictment.

The next question is whether the charged participation in a criminal organization has been established.

Structure and sustainability

The evidence used shows that an organization with a certain structure and sustainability has existed. This structure is expressed in the relationships that various people have had with each other, whereby various activities with a criminal orientation have been carried out. There was a certain division of roles, which, although varied within a bandwidth, generally has continuity. The activities also show a repeating pattern.

The sustainability and structure are given with the above. For a period of considerable duration, the persons named in the statement of evidence have operated in a stable form of cooperation.

Purpose of the organization

The objective of the organization has unmistakably consisted of bottle pulling and bankruptcy fraud. The participants had a common orientation on these points.

The suspect as a participant

Finally, the suspect's participation in the organization. Participation in an organization as referred to in Article 140 of the Penal Code can only exist if two requirements are met:

1) the suspect is part of a partnership with a sustainable or structured character; and

2) the suspect has a share in, or supports, conduct aimed at or directly related to the realization of the purpose referred to in those articles.

The Court of Appeal is of the opinion that the suspect's contribution has been substantial and can therefore be regarded as participation within the meaning of Article 140 of the Dutch Criminal Code. Spread over a considerable part of the alleged offense was committed show the activities of the defendant which may be regarded as a relevant and continuous contribution to the cooperation and the realization of the objective. The suspect himself once participated in the fraudulent construction that made the bottle-making facility possible. He also transported goods over a long period of several years, thereby realizing the organization's objective of making money through the sale of goods whose suppliers are not paid.

This means that the defenses for acquittal of the charges under 1 are rejected.

Fact 2

Under 2, the co-perpetration of bottle-pulling in the context of "case 8" is charged to the suspect.

Position of the Advocate General

The Advocate General has requested proof of this fact.

Position of the defense

The counselor has requested an acquittal. She argued primarily that the suspect had no intent and, in the alternative, took the position that there had been no co-perpetration.

Judgment of the court

What the Court of Appeal has considered in the key to participation in a criminal organization, the Court of Appeal considers that it is partly reasonable for the evidence that the suspect had knowledge of the bottle-pulling operation that was committed in the context of case 8. This implies that during the activities he carried out he had set-up at that bottle-puller.

The Court of Appeal furthermore deduces from the evidence that some co-suspects, in particular suspect 2 and suspect 5, were engaged in the purchase of goods that were not paid. suspect 1 usually sold the goods. The suspect has regularly transported goods, both from the addresses of suppliers and to the addresses of buyers. The goods were usually delivered quickly. In a number of cases, the suspect was paid by the customers. In the pattern of the flow of goods, in which hundreds of thousands of euros of goods were ordered and purchased in a few months, the suspect together with suspect 3 was the permanent driver. The Court of Appeal furthermore assumes that the success of the bottle factory as committed on this scale, was partly dependent on a quick result when selling the purchased goods. The suspect has made a significant contribution to that business process.

However, the file does not offer sufficient starting points for making actual findings with sufficient precision about the extent of that contribution. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the suspect's contribution has been of such significance that the co-perpetration of a bottle-puller can be explained. The suspect will therefore be acquitted of what is charged primarily under 2.

In any case, there was talk of complicity in bottle-pulling, as charged in the alternative under 2. The court will declare that proven.

This means that the defenses seeking acquittal of the charges under 2 are rejected to that extent.

Punishability of the proven

No circumstance has become plausible that excludes the punishability of what has been proven in the alternative under 1 and 2, so that it is punishable.

The certified under 1 provides:

participation in an organization for the purpose of committing crimes.

The certified alternative under 2 yields:

complicity in co-perpetrating a habit of purchasing goods for the purpose of securing access to those goods for another or a third party without full payment.

Punishability of the suspect

No circumstance has become plausible that excludes the suspect's punishability with regard to the evidence proven in the alternative under 1 and 2, so that the suspect is punishable.

Imposition of punishment

The Amsterdam District Court sentenced the accused for the first proven statement under 1 and 2 to a term of imprisonment for 24 months, of which 8 months suspended, with a probationary period of 3 years. Furthermore, decisions have been taken regarding the claims of the injured parties, as further described in the judgment, the appeal of which is described.

The Advocate General has requested that the accused for primary charges under 1 and 2 be sentenced to 24 months' imprisonment, of which 8 months are conditional, with a probationary period of 3 years, as well as a professional prohibition, including that for five years after he has served his prison sentence, the suspect may not be a statutory or factual director or partner of any legal person as referred to in Article 51 of the Penal Code (Penal Code).

On appeal, the Court of Appeal determined the punishment to be imposed on the basis of the seriousness of the facts and the circumstances in which they were committed and in view of the person of the suspect. The Court of Appeal in particular took the following into consideration.

The suspect has been part of a criminal organization that has been involved for a period of several years in the systematic committing of bottle-pulling in an organized context. The co-perpetrators used companies specially set up for this purpose . In some cases, a company with a good reputation had been in existence for some time.

The organization turned out to be able to present these companies to the outside world in a very short time as successful, bona fide companies. To this end, business premises were taken into use, which were subsequently equipped for both equipment and personnel. The digital infrastructure was also provided, while the financial side was also covered by the preparation of false annual accounts filed with the Chamber of Commerce. Members of the criminal organization often have unsuspecting entrepreneurs using false namesapproached in order to order goods on a very large scale, often for tens of thousands of euros at the same time. In addition, they did not hesitate to first pay a number of small invoices in order to create confidence, so that a major blow could be made shortly thereafter.

With the rise in unpaid bills and with it the chance of being caught, the used companies were administratively often transferred to catchers. Bankruptcies followed and the bankruptcy trustees were blunted by the efforts of those catcatchers in retrieving the records and addressing those who had caused the damage. As a result, creditors saw their claims go up in smoke. While victims and bankruptcy trustees were still looking for traces of goods, administration, liable persons and benefits, the suspect and his co-perpetrators were already fully engaged in their fraudulent practices in a new enterprise . The resulting damage runs into the many hundreds of thousands of euros.

The suspect was involved in many of the companies used by the criminal organization . The role of the suspect consisted in particular of transporting the ordered and unpaid goods to customers of the criminal organization and to repositories. For that work, the suspect was paid per day from the criminal proceeds.

The extract from the Judicial Documentation of 11 February 2019, filed in the name of the suspect, shows that the suspect was sentenced in 2009 by the Arnhem court of justice to years of imprisonment for Opium Act crimes. Even during the period of the conditional release followed by this sentence, the suspect was again guilty of committing criminal offenses, as the present statement of evidence shows. The court of appeal takes this circumstance into account in the aggravating sense.

In determining the applicable maximum penalty, the Court of Appeal assumes that the participation in a criminal organization declared as proven under 1 is in a relationship of simultaneous coincidence with the complicity as stated under 2 for bottle-pulling.

Taking all of the above into account, the court considers a prison sentence for twenty-four months, six of which is conditional, with a probationary period of three years in place. The statement of defense that in the event of a statement of evidence it could suffice to impose a work sentence and a fully conditional prison sentence does not do justice to the nature and seriousness of the proven facts, so the court of appeal ignores this. The court of appeal comes to a higher penalty than that requested by the advocate general, because the court finds the seriousness of the facts and the aforementioned recidivism insufficiently expressed in the claim.

The claim for the imposition of the additional penalty of disqualification from the right to exercise the profession of director under the articles of association is rejected. Participation in a criminal organization, as proven under 1, is not a case determined by law that makes it possible to impose such an additional penalty. With regard to fact 2, complicity in co-perpetrating bottle-making, it cannot be established that the suspect was a statutory director of case 8 and committed the practice of that profession, which implies the additional punishment of dismay from a profession is a requirement ex article 339, first paragraph, Sr. Imposition of the requested penalty would therefore be contrary to the law.

The Court of Appeal officially determines that the reasonable period as referred to in Article 6, paragraph 1 of the European Convention for Protectionof Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) has been exceeded. The starting point in this case is that the hearing must be concluded with a final judgment within two years after an appeal has been lodged, unless there are special circumstances, such as the complexity of a case, the influence of the suspect and / or or his counsel on the course of the proceedings and the way in which the case has been handled by the competent authorities. The Court of Appeal has not proved such special circumstances. With regard to the procedure on appeal, the suspect filed an appeal on December 15, 2016. The court of appeal pronounces judgment on 5 April 2019. The Court of Appeal is of the opinion that, given the course of the proceedings, the reasonable period has been exceeded by approximately three months and three weeks. Because of this slight exceedance, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that it is sufficient to simply state that an infringement of Art. 6, first paragraph, ECHR.

Claims from the injured parties supplier CC, supplier DD, supplier EE, supplier FF, supplier GG, supplier HH and supplier II

The counselor has defended various aspects of the claims of the injured parties. Even if these aspects are not taken into consideration, the following should also be taken into consideration.

Under 1, the suspect was charged with participation in a criminal organization. In connection with this fact, the claims of the aforementioned seven injured parties, which claim to have suffered damage as a result of bottle pulling, are under discussion. The injured parties have each stated that they have suffered damage as a result of the fact that Case 13 took goods from them without paying for them. Involvement of the suspect in this company has been charged to the suspect in the context of fact 1 and, as previously considered in this judgment, the court will also declare proven.

The question arises in this state of affairs, even if it is assumed that the damage suffered by each of the injured parties as a result of a shortcoming in performance attributable to the company is sufficiently directly related to the proven declared fact and the damage suffered, as referred to in Article 361, second paragraph, of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Sv). To this end, the following is considered.

The suspect participated in a criminal organization that had as its object, among other things, the commission of bottle-pulling. This organization, as evidenced by the statement of evidence, used companies, including case 13. This participation, proven to be chargeable to the suspect, is not sufficient as such to assume a direct connection with the damage suffered. The specific circumstances of the case, which must be apparent from the evidence, determine the answer to the question whether there is a direct link referred to above. The means of evidence mean that the suspect, together with a few other persons, performed work within case 13. These have consisted of transporting the delivered goods. The suspect was also registered as a director at the Chamber of Commerce for some time. The Court of Appeal considers that it has been proven, as considered, that the suspect has thereby acted in the knowledge that he thus facilitated the bottle-puller. There was some cooperation within the company. No more precise determinations can be made about the share of each of the persons involved. Neither is it about the intensity of the cooperation or about the way in which the group was operated. The evidence presented has a fairly general character in that regard. No more precise determinations can be made about the share of each of the persons involved. Neither is it about the intensity of the cooperation or about the way in which the group was operated. The evidence presented has a fairly general character in that regard. No more precise determinations can be made about the share of each of the persons involved. Neither is it about the intensity of the cooperation or about the way in which the group was operated. The evidence presented has a fairly general character in that regard.

The foregoing considerably complicates the assessment of the claims. Without further investigation sufficient findings of a factual nature cannot be made with this state of affairs. This impossibility concerns individual conduct of the suspect, which is causally related to damage suffered that can be attributed to the suspect on that ground, but it also extends to possible behavior in a group context to which Article 6: 166, first paragraph, of the Dutch Civil Code and who, according to standards developed in case law , can establish individual liability of the suspect under certain circumstances.

In addition to these civil-law complications, the court is also faced with issues of a criminal nature. These are partly intertwined with the aforementioned civil law questions. In particular, it concerns answering the question of the direct link between the role of the suspect evidenced by the evidence and the damage suffered.

This leads to the conclusion that the required further investigation , if and insofar as this would lead to a result, results in a disproportionate burden on the criminal proceedings. The injured parties supplier CC, supplier DD, supplier EE, supplier FF, supplier GG, supplier HH and supplier II will therefore be declared inadmissible in their claims.
