3.1
Parties were married in 1993 at the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam.


3.2
Parties have the Dutch nationality.


3.3
From the marriage of parties - as far as relevant here - is born:

- the minor in 2010.

In addition, they have three adult children .


4 The scope of the dispute

4.1
In the contested decision, where divorce is relevant, divorce between the parties was pronounced at the request of the wife .


4.2
The husband requests that, in so far as the contested decision is annulled, the wife be declared inadmissible in her preliminary application for divorce or reject her request for divorce .


4.3
The wife requests that the husband's requests be rejected and - as the court understands - to ratify the contested decision.


5 The reasons for the decision

5.1
The man argues on appeal that the marriage of the parties has not been permanently disrupted and that the court has wrongly pronounced divorce between the parties. The woman has not substantiated her view that the marriage would have been permanently disrupted, so the woman should be declared inadmissible, the man said.

The man is also fundamentally opposed to divorce . He was not married to the wife and then divorced . According to the man, there are also no significant problems between parties, at least no problems that cannot be solved.


5.2
The woman argues that the marriage of parties has been difficult for many years and arguments have been the order of the day. Parties no longer live in the same house since July 2018 . The man is very aggressive and quickly seeks physical violence. She is afraid of the man and fears of her life. She has reported the threat to the police to the police . She has an Aware alarm system, but has also had to apply for a street and contact ban from the court, which has been granted. The man visited the woman during a holiday in Turkey and (again) abused him . She reported this to the police in Turkey. According to the woman it is marriage, in view of the foregoing, indeed sustainable disruption. She maintains her position that she wants a divorce .


5.3
The court considers as follows. Pursuant to Article 1: 151 of the Dutch Civil Code, the divorce can be pronounced at the request of one of the spouses, if the marriage is permanently disrupted. To answer the question whether the marriage has been permanently disrupted, the situation at the time of the divorce judgment must be assumed . In doing so, account can also be taken of facts and circumstances that only occurred in the course of the proceedings.

The woman has argued that she is not prepared to resume society with the man and she persists in her request for divorce . The court already sees this as a clear indication that the marriage has been permanently disrupted. It is also established that since July 2018 the parties no longer live together. In addition, contact bans with women have been imposed on men both in the Netherlands and, as it appeared at the hearing on appeal, in Turkey . These facts and circumstances are sufficient to establish that the marriage of parties has been permanently disrupted; what the man has argued against this is insufficient to come to another conclusion.


5.4
This leads to the following decision.

ratifies the order, of which appeal, insofar as subject to the judgment of the court.
