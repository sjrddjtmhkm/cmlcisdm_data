The following were present:

- the woman, assisted by FJ van Arum-van Zwieten, LL.M.

- the council , represented by Mrs. DM van Dijk.


2.4
The man, although quite summoned, did not appear.


2.5.
A record was drawn up of the session, which was sent to the parties and to the council .


3 The facts

3.1
Parties have had a relationship. They are the parents of:

- daughter (hereinafter: the minor ), born in 2013 at the place of birth. The man has recognized the minor . the minor lives with the woman.


3.2
By order of July 29, 2015 of the Noord-Holland District Court (Alkmaar), it is determined - insofar as it is currently relevant - that the minor will stay with the man for a weekend once every fourteen days from Friday 5:00 pm to Sunday 5:00 pm and every Wednesday from 11:30 AM to 6:30 PM.


3.3
By the decision of 20 December 2017, which has not been challenged, the court terminated the joint authority of the parties and charged the woman with sole authority over the minor .


4 The scope of the dispute

4.1
The contested decision stipulates, insofar as currently relevant, with a corresponding amendment to the decision of the Noord-Holland District Court of 29 July 2015, that the man picks up the minor from school every Wednesday at 12:30 pm (and if there are no school, with the woman) and returns to the woman at 5:30 PM.


4.2
The woman requests, with the annulment of the contested decision to that extent and with a corresponding amendment to the decision of the court of 29 July 2015, to provide that the man picks up the minor from school every Wednesday at 14:00 (and if there is no school is with the woman) and returns to the woman at 5:30 pm, at least to take such a decision as the court deems appropriate.


5 The reasons for the decision

5.1
Pursuant to Article 1: 377e of the Civil Code (BW), the court may, at the request of the parents or of one of them or the person who is in close personal relationship with the child, make a decision regarding intercourse and a mutual decision taken by the parents change of access arrangements on the ground that afterwards the circumstances have changed or that incorrect or incomplete information was assumed when the decision was made.


5.2
The woman states - briefly and concisely summarized - that the starting time of the access arrangement should be changed to 2:00 pm, because the minor is in school until that time and she is also obliged to attend school from April 1, 2018.


5.3
The council advised at the hearing to order an investigation into the most desirable access arrangement and requested that the case be continued to enable the council to conduct a protection investigation . It must be considered to what extent an access arrangement is in the best interests of the minor . Furthermore, it is advisable not to lay down a visiting arrangement pending the outcome of the investigation .


5.4
The court considers as follows. At the hearing it became clear that the man is suffering from addiction problems and that there has actually been no interaction between the man and the minor since last summer . the minor has experienced more peace since then and no longer wants to go to the man, according to the woman at the hearing.

The man did not appear at the hearing or submitted any documents. Thus, it is not known how he is doing now. Before deciding, the court also needs further information. The Court of Appeal will request the Council to conduct an investigation to answer the following question:

- is a change in access arrangements in the best interests of the minor ?

The Court of Appeal will also stay the case in order to enable the council to extend this investigation to a protection investigation . The court of appeal will continue to handle the case pro forma until Sunday, April 21, 2019. The council is requested to submit a written report and advice to the court before the aforementioned date on the results of the investigation . In doing so, the council can take into account the fact that a council report from 2017 is already available.


5.5
Pending the aforementioned council report, the court will adopt a provisional access arrangement as requested by the woman. The court of appeal will determine - with amendment of the order of the Noord-Holland court of July 29, 2015 - that the man and the minor are provisionally entitled to have intercourse with each other, so that the man takes the minor every Wednesday at 2:00 pm from picks up the school (and if there is no school, from the woman) and returns it to the woman at 5:30 PM.


6 The decision
The court:

before deciding further:

stipulates - until further decisions have been taken - to amend the order of the Noord-Holland court of 29 July 2015 to the extent that, as a provisional access arrangement , the man picks up the minor from school every Wednesday at 2:00 pm (and if there is no school is with the woman) and returns to the woman at 5:30 pm;
