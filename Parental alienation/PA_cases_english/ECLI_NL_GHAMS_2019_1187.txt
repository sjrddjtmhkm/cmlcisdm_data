What has been charged in the alternative under 1 and 2 more or differently has not been proven. The suspect must be acquitted of this.

The Court of Appeal bases its conviction that the accused committed the proven statement on the facts and circumstances contained in the means of proof, as they are included in the annex to this judgment.

Evidence

The suspect is blamed under fact 1 for having participated in a criminal organization. The aim of the organization would have been, among other things, bottle-pulling and bankruptcy fraud. The members of the organization were alleged to have worked as a way of operating a business for several months , with large-scale purchases of goods. After that usually a bankruptcy followed and the recovery options of creditors were deliberately made more difficult. Under fact 2, the accused is primarily blamed for guilty of co-perpetrating bottle-pulling and, in the alternative, for having been accessory to that bottle-pulling.

Position of the Advocate General

The Advocate General has requested that the Court of Appeal declare facts 1 and 2 primarily proven.

Position of the defense

The counselor has requested an acquittal. With regard to fact 1, she argued that the statements of suspect 1 and suspect 2 for the unreliability of those statements should be excluded from the evidence. To that end, it was stated that suspect 1 tried to shift the blame on others and instructed fellow suspects, put them under pressure and sometimes even threatened to make pleasing statements. According to the counselor, the statements of suspect 2 are possible the same can be said, since Defendant 2, while at the court hearing, has stated that he supports his statements he made at the FIOD, but that he has suddenly assigned different roles to persons and therefore also declared contradictory to those he had previously statements made.

Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence for the concrete knowledge of the suspect of the suspected criminal organization and the intention of the suspect on the purpose of the organization, so that there can be no question of participation.

Regarding fact 2, it has been argued that it cannot be proven that the suspect had intent at the bottle-puller. In addition, the behavior of the suspect cannot be qualified as co-perpetrators or complicity. With regard to the complicity, the counselor also argued that the bottle-puller had already been completed when the management of the company had been transferred to the suspect. He may not have had a role in the preparation or in the implementation of the bottle factory.

Judgment of the court

Fact 1

With regard to the defense seeking to exclude evidence from the statements of suspect 1 and suspect 2, the Court of Appeal considered as follows.

suspect 1, after not having explained much at first, prepared a written statement on January 21, 2016, which is in the file. In it he stated that he had initially started participating in the business of the first companies without criminal intentions, but that this was later changed. Soon a practice had arisen of companies with a short life cycle, whereby the core of business operations consisted of ordering goods without paying for them. Suspect 1 briefly described the course of events per company. He has charged himself and the other parties involved. As a witness, heard by the examining magistrate on 30 June 2016, suspect 1 stated further. He said that all involved were aware of the fact that they were so-called "thuds". This also applies to the suspect, about whom suspect 1 said that suspect 13 did the "dying house constructions" "concerning the delivery or takeover of BVs via suspect 7". He also said: “Suspect 7 has been 99% involved in the death house constructions. A BV was transferred after working with it, when there was too much nagging. Then suspect 7 was brought in via suspect 13. suspect 2 kept in touch with suspect 7. Payment was made if a BV was transferred. € 2,500 per BV was paid; that was intended for suspect 7 ". about whom suspect 1 said that suspect 13 did the "dying house constructions" "concerning the delivery or takeover of BVs via suspect 7". He also said: “Suspect 7 has been 99% involved in the death house constructions. A BV was transferred after working with it, when there was too much nagging. Then suspect 7 was brought in via suspect 13. suspect 2 kept in touch with suspect 7. Payment was made if a BV was transferred. € 2,500 per BV was paid; that was intended for suspect 7 ". about whom suspect 1 said that suspect 13 did the "dying house constructions" "concerning the delivery or takeover of BVs via suspect 7". He also said: “Suspect 7 has been 99% involved in the death house constructions. A BV was transferred after working with it, when there was too much nagging. Then suspect 7 was brought in via suspect 13. suspect 2 kept in touch with suspect 7. Payment was made if a BV was transferred. € 2,500 per BV was paid; that was intended for suspect 7 ". suspect 2 kept in touch with suspect 7. Payment was made if a BV was transferred. € 2,500 per BV was paid; that was intended for suspect 7 ". suspect 2 kept in touch with suspect 7. Payment was made if a BV was transferred. € 2,500 per BV was paid; that was intended for suspect 7 ".

As a motive for giving “opening of cases”, suspect 1 mentions the fact that the other suspects tried to blame him.

The defense has pointed to putting the blame on others, instructing fellow suspects and putting pressure on or sometimes threatening fellow suspects. As the court understands, the defense has an eye on the eavesdropping and recorded telephone conversations between suspect 1 and his father , the co-suspect suspect 3, during the first months that suspect 1 was detained. In these conversations, the current investigation is apparently being discussed. In the investigationSubjects involved are discussed, whether or not based on a nickname. More specifically, it concerns the interrogations that will be taken from them and the expected content of their statements. From the conversations it can be deduced that suspect 1 tries to take control and says what each of them must explain, apparently with the aim of limiting the damage for him, suspect 1. To this end it is agreed, among other things, that his father has visited some of them or is going to visit them. Suspect 1 speaks about the desired content of their statements in terms such that those involved "just have to be honest" and "just have to tell the truth". And regarding suspect 2, it appears that suspect 1 wants him to "keep his mouth shut".

In retrospect, based on the statements of suspect 1 himself but also those of suspect 2, it is evident that the honesty and truth that suspect 1 spoke about in these conversations did not have the meaning they have in the usual language. suspect 1 wanted to manipulate those involved and to control what would be declared by co-suspects for the benefit of his interests in his own criminal case.

However, there is insufficient ground in this course of action to assume that the later will continue

statements made by the suspect 1 are unreliable and cannot be used for the evidence. Viewed in the light of his later statements, in which he also entrusts himself, it can be concluded that the truthfulness of what was shared in the tap conversations is very low. Moreover, it is clear that suspect 1 spoke with his father in a context that he considered confidential. It does not concern statements made which he later fully or partially returned to. Also in that respect there is no reason to conclude that the telephone conversations between suspect 1 and his father disqualify his later statementsas useful means of proof. In addition, the wish expressed by suspect 1 that suspect 2 will keep his mouth shut fits in with the context of the confessional statements later made by suspect 2 in which suspect 1 is also charged. Contrary to what was put forward by the defense, the court considers the statements of suspect 2 to be consistent. The court of appeal has proved to be inconsistent with contradictions, as argued by the defense.

Incidentally, the statements of suspect 1 and suspect 2 with regard to the procedure followed in the different companies are not only confirmed in each other's statements, but also in the file. The declarations of suspect 1 and suspect 2 fit in with many relevant details in the declarations or declarations of injured suppliers and the declarations made by the bankruptcy trustees involved in the various bankruptcieshave been taken. Anchoring is also provided by numerous documents in the file, which show the working method described by suspect 1 and suspect 2, whereby invoices had to give a distorted picture of the course of affairs when goods are delivered to customers. Many notes contain the comment that one part is paid in cash and another part will be paid by bank. According to suspect 1, the latter did not take place.

On the basis of all of the foregoing, the conclusion must be that the statements of suspect 1 he made before the examining magistrate and his aforementioned written statement, as well as the statements of suspect 2, made before the FIOD and as witness at the hearing at the court, even where they are burdensome for the suspect, are usable for the evidence. The statements of the suspect himself also offer no clues to assume that suspect 1 and / or suspect 2 have or may have had motives for taxing the suspect on incorrect grounds.

It was further argued on behalf of the suspect that he had no knowledge of the criminal organization, and thus could not be regarded as a participant in that organization. The Court of Appeal comes to a different conclusion on the basis of the content of the means of evidence to be mentioned, which are included in the annex to this judgment.

The evidence follows that there has been a collaboration of several people with a degree of permanence and structure, in a period of almost four years using fourteen successive businesses systematic crimes committedsuch as bankruptcy fraud and bottling. On the basis of the relevant content of, among other things, the statements of the co-suspects suspect 1, as he made before the examining magistrate on 30 June 2016 and expressed in his written statement of 21 January 2016 and the statements of the suspect 2 before the FIOD and as a witness at the court hearing, the criminal organization consisted of persons who were involved in the purchase (suspect 2, suspect 5 and suspect 6), persons who were involved in the sale(suspect 1), catcatchers (suspect 10, suspect 11 and the suspect) and persons in charge of transporting the goods (suspect 4 and suspect 3). suspect 1 and suspect 2 can be regarded as central and / or leading persons of this criminal organization. The method used by these and their co-suspects amounted to a companyor legal person administratively, inter alia by fictitious annual figures, and physically, inter alia, by the establishment of office locations, was rigged in such a way that potential suppliers of goods to be ordered by the suspects were led to believe that they had a long-standing stability , continuity and reliability characterized counterparty / buyer. Several people made use of a false name. Subsequently, in a period of a few weeks or months, a large number of goods were ordered from several suppliers who, deceived by the façade outlined above, often proceeded to deliver goods before they were paid. The unpaid goods thus acquired were then quickly resold by the suspects to various customers.business activities were acutely terminated, the office building was abandoned and a cat-catcher, including in several of the present cases, was appointed as director of the company . Partly in light of what the counselor has argued, the court finds itself faced with the question of whether the suspect has participated in this criminal organization.

The Court of Appeal first and foremost states that participation in an organization as referred to in Article 140 of the Penal Code (Sr) can only be deemed to exist if the suspect is part of the partnership and has a share in conduct that extends to or is directly related to with the achievement of the purpose referred to in that article, or supports these behaviors.

From the evidence it appears that the suspect was involved in seven of the fourteen companies , with the aid of which systematic bottle-pulling and fraudulent bank breach were committed during the almost four-year investigation period . This involvement of the suspect consisted in the fact that in the final phase he became director of the company with which the bottling plant was committed, whether or not indirectly . As part of his involvement, the suspect maintained contact with his fellow suspects, visited the Chamber of Commerce and / or curators on several occasions and placed his signatures. The appointment of the suspect as director at the various companiestook place for the first time on 15 March 2012 (case 15), then on 12 October 2012 (case 2), on 14 March 2013 (case 1 and case 9), on 26 May 2014 (case 6), on 25 August 2014 (case 18) and on October 16, 2014 (case 8). Through his role as 'cat-catcher', the suspect contributed to the fact that the victims were denied their view of the co-suspects who were directly involved in the many cases of bottle-pulling, and he indemnified the latter of the legal aftermath of a bankruptcy. giving them the opportunity to (continue to) follow the same working method. The suspect was paid for his contribution.

The suspect has acknowledged his involvement with the companies .

In his statement of 4 February 2015 to the FIOD, the suspect states, among other things:

“ With a new case it went on again from the beginning. After bankruptcy, suspect 2 and suspect 1 asked if I would like to become a manager of their new case. (...) I think I have received a payment of € 1,300 7 or 8 or 9 times . "

On 11 February 2015, the suspect states:

“ And after such a bankruptcy, suspect 2 said that we would continue with a new company. And a new company also means pay. "And confronted with the statement of co-suspect suspect 2 during a telephone conversation with the suspect dated October 27, 2014 , saying " You are ready for us, right? " , The suspect explains in the same interrogation:" Suspect 2 means that I am always in business as a manager the firms accused 1 and accused 2 treed . "

From this statement of suspect 2 and the interpretation thereof by the suspect it can be concluded, in the opinion of the court of appeal, that confidence in the commitment of the suspect to (always) act as a cat catcher has promoted the business activities of his co-suspects and that the suspect was aware of this.

The question of whether the suspect in general knew that the corporate activities of his co-suspects were of a criminal nature, in the sense that the suspect knew that the organization had committed crimes, must be judged by the court - despite the denial by the suspect - answered in the affirmative.

The suspect has stated that he has been alerted by suspect 13 to suspect 1 and suspect 2. In addition, a conversation report dated 8 April 2013, prepared by the bankruptcy trustee regarding case 2, shows that the suspect (and suspect 13 alias alias suspect 13) repeatedly raise the issue of fraudsters and that suspect 1 and his bellboy suspect 2 earn the money. Finally, the co-suspect suspect 1, among other things in his testimony of 30 June 2016, also made in the criminal case against the suspect, stated that “everyone”, whereby he also specifically mentioned the name of the suspect, knew that it BVs were ". Regarding the suspect's contribution, suspect 1 stated as stated above.

All in all, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that it has been legally and convincingly proven that the suspect participated in an organization whose purpose was to commit crimes as charged under 1.

Fact 2

Under 2 the accused is charged with the involvement, in the sense of co-perpetrating (primary) or complicity (in the alternative), in the bottle-pulling company that took place with / by the company case 8.

From the available evidence it follows that this bottle-pulling operation took place, as charged. case 8 was one of the companies discussed above in the context of the criminal organization with which many purchases were made that were subsequently not paid. The question that is currently before us is whether the suspect's involvement in this enterprise has been such that he can be held criminally liable as (co-) perpetrator of or accessory to that bottle-puller.

With the advocate general and the counselor , the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that it cannot be established that the suspect's contribution was of such importance that he can be regarded as (co-) perpetrator.

Together with the Advocate General and unlike the counselor , the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that the role of the accused as an accomplice can be considered to be legal and convincingly proven.

The essence of the counsel 's defense is that it takes the position that the suspect's contribution has been limited to the so-called crash phase. According to the counselor , this means that the suspect only became involved when the offense, the bottle-puller, had already been completed.

The court considers as follows.

Article 48 of the Criminal Code intends to criminalize the promotion and / or facilitation of a crime committed by another. It should be noted in this regard that supporting behaviors that are performed after the crime has ended as such fall outside the scope of Article 48 Penal Code.

Prior to the evaluation of the evidence presented, the court considers the following with regard to the nature of the charged offense. Bottle puller is characterized in particular by two components. Firstly, it concerns a multitude of cases of purchasing goods or purchasing services. Secondly, the crime is constituted by the absence of payment. This means that the offense is characterized by a certain duration and a continuous nature. Moreover, the constituent element that does not continue to be paid implies that the offense is only realized after some time in which a payment obligation has not always been met.

With regard to the facts, the following is added. In the first place, it must be stated that the accused's contribution, namely the case-name filing on 8 October 16 October 2014, should not only be regarded as a supportive behavior after the end of the crime. The so-called crash phase was a pre-planned part of the cycle of criminal acts. It was the part in which the proceeds were secured and the traces were erased. As can be inferred from the premise above, this part is part of the offense. The suspect played an important role in this.

In the second place, the suspect took office on 16 October 2014 as director of case 8 and after that activities took place in the context of the (criminal) management of case 8. For example, it can be deduced from the file that the deliveries by the affected suppliers took place in the period from 27 August 2014 up to and including 30 November 2014, the delivery from the supplier 22 was picked up on 20 October 2014 and the repairs were made ( on) payment to supplier supplier 26 reversed on October 23, 2014. In that respect, the statements of the council fold also lack factual basis.

The Court of Appeal concludes that the suspect had carried out supporting acts at the bottle factory during the period in which this fact was committed. The defense that opposes such a conclusion is rejected.

The Court of Appeal considers that the charges made under 2 in the alternative are legally and conclusively proven.

Punishability of the proven

No circumstance has become plausible that excludes the punishability of what has been proven in the alternative under 1 and 2, so that it is punishable.

The certified under 1 provides:

participation in an organization for the purpose of committing crimes.

The certified alternative under 2 yields:

complicity in co-perpetrating a habit of purchasing goods for the purpose of securing access to those goods for another or a third party without full payment.

Punishability of the suspect

No circumstance has become plausible that excludes the suspect's punishability with regard to the evidence proven in the alternative under 1 and 2, so that the suspect is punishable.

Imposition of penalties

The Amsterdam District Court acquitted the defendant for the charges against him at first instance under 2 and, in respect of what was declared subsidiary under 1 and 2, sentenced him to a term of imprisonment for 10 months as well as a professional prohibition, which meant that the defendant five years after he has served his prison sentence, he may not be a statutory or factual director or a partner of any legal person.

The Advocate General has requested that the accused be sentenced to the same penalties as imposed by the court of first instance.

On appeal, the Court of Appeal determined the penalties to be imposed on the basis of the seriousness of the facts and the circumstances in which they were committed and in view of the person of the suspect. The Court of Appeal in particular took the following into consideration.

The suspect has been a member of a criminal organization that has been involved for a period of several years in the systematic commissioning of bottle-pulling in an organized context. The suspect and his co-perpetrators used specially established companies for this purpose . In some cases, a company with a good reputation had been in existence for some time.

The organization turned out to be able to present these companies to the outside world in a very short time as successful, bona fide companies. To this end, business premises were taken into use, which were subsequently equipped for both equipment and personnel. The digital infrastructure was also provided, while the financial side was also covered by the preparation of false annual accounts filed with the Chamber of Commerce. Some members of the organization often have unsuspecting entrepreneurs using false namesapproached in order to order goods on a very large scale, often for tens of thousands of euros at the same time. In doing so, there was no hesitation in first paying a number of small invoices in order to generate trust, so that a major blow could be made shortly thereafter.

With the rise in unpaid bills and with it the chance of being caught, the used companies were administratively transferred to catchers. The suspect was one of those catcatchers; the suspect acted in that capacity at seven of the companies in the Bommel investigation . Bankruptcies followed and the bankruptcy trustees caught, due to the deployment of the suspect as a cat catcher, blunt in retrieving the administration and addressing those who had caused the damage. As a result, creditors saw their claims go up in smoke. While victims and curatorswere still looking for traces of goods, administration, liable persons and benefits, the members of the organization were already fully engaged in their fraudulent practices in a new enterprise , after which the suspect was reinstated at the end of the existence of that subsequent enterprise . image came as a cat catcher.

The damage caused by the criminal organization runs into the many hundreds of thousands of euros.

From the extract from the Judicial Documentation of 11 February 2019 in the name of the suspect, it follows that the suspect had not previously come into contact with the police and the judicial authorities for similar facts, which has a moderating influence on the punishment to be imposed.

In determining the applicable maximum penalty, the Court of Appeal assumes that the participation in a criminal organization declared as proven under 1 is in a proportion of one-to-one coincidence with the explained under 2 subsidiary evidence of complicity in the participation in bottle-pulling.

Taking all of the above into consideration, the court considers a prison sentence for the duration of fifteen months, of which five months conditionally with a probationary period of three years, is appropriate. The Court of Appeal thus comes to a higher penalty than that requested by the Advocate General, because the Court finds the seriousness of the facts in the claim insufficiently expressed.

The court shall of its own motion determine that the reasonable period as referred to in Article 6, paragraph 1 of the European Convention for Protectionof Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) has been exceeded. The starting point in this case is that the hearing must be concluded with a final judgment within two years after an appeal has been lodged, unless there are special circumstances, such as the complexity of a case, the influence of the suspect and / or or his counsel on the procedure and the way in which the case has been handled by the competent authorities. The Court of Appeal has not proved such special circumstances. With regard to the procedure on appeal, the suspect filed an appeal on December 9, 2016. The court of appeal pronounces judgment on 5 April 2019. The Court of Appeal is of the opinion that, given the course of the proceedings, the reasonable period has been exceeded by approximately three months and three weeks.

In view of the nature and seriousness of the evidence stated under 2 and for the protection of society, the Court of Appeal also considers it appropriate and appropriate to impose an additional punishment on the accused of the right to exercise, in accordance with the advocate-general's claim of the profession of statutory director. After all, the suspect has committed the crime proven under 2 in the capacity of that appeal, which requires Article 339, first paragraph, Penal Code. The Court of Appeal sets the term of this expulsion at five years.

Taking all things into account, the Court of Appeal considers a partially conditional prison sentence and a professional prohibition of the duration to be reported to be appropriate and appropriate.

Temporary custody

On December 1, 2016, the court ordered the lifting of the suspension of the pre-trial detention of the suspect. In the absence of a position from the parties, the Court of Appeal is faced with the question whether it should decide on this on its own initiative. The court of appeal is of the opinion that, now that the presence of grounds has not been established, the order for pre-trial detention must be lifted. The court will thus decide.

Applicable legal requirements

The penalties to be imposed are based on Articles 14a, 14b, 14c, 28, 31, 48, 55, 140, 326a and 339 of the Criminal Code .

These legal regulations are applied as applicable at the time of the proven.

DECISION

The court:

Destroys the judgment that appeals and does justice again:

Declares that it has not been proven that the accused committed the charges under 2, and acquits the accused of this.

Declares, as considered above, proven that the suspect committed the charges under 1 and 2 in the alternative.

Does not explain what the accused has been charged more or differently than has been proven above and acquits the accused of this.

Declares the offense declared subsidiary under 1 and 2 to be punishable, qualifies as aforementioned and declares the suspect punishable.

Sentences the suspect to imprisonment for 15 (fifteen) months .

Determines that a part of the prison sentence, large 5 (five) months , will not be enforced, unless the judge may order otherwise later because the suspect committed a criminal offense before the end of a probationary period of 3 (three) years guilty.

Recommends that the time taken by the accused before the implementation of that decision only in Article 27, paragraph, or Article 27a of the Code of Criminal will be referred to as pre-trial detention was spent in the execution of the sentence of imprisonment reduced , in so far as that time has not already been deducted from another penalty.

Relieves the suspect of the right to exercise the profession of statutory director, de facto director or partner of any legal person for a period of 5 (five) years .

Holds the order for pre-trial detention.

This judgment was delivered by the multiple criminal chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal, which included SMM Bordenga , RM Steinhaus and W. Foppen, in the presence of NR Achterberg, Registrar, and was heard at the public hearing of this court of 5 April 2019.
