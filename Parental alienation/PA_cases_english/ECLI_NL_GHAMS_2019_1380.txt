5 The reasons for the decision
In the case with case number 200.247.224 / 01


5.1
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 1: 266 (1) of the Civil Code (BW), the court may terminate the authority of a parent if:

a. A minor so grows that in his development seriously being threatened , and the parent is not responsible for the care and education provided for in Article 1: 247 paragraph 2 BW is able to contribute within the person and the development term considered acceptable by the minor , or

b. the parent abuses the authority .


5.2
The mother argues that the grounds of Article 1: 266 of the Dutch Civil Code are not met. When the minor was still living with her, he was doing well; he was in high school and played football regularly. The mother called in the Oppoedpoli and other organizations for his behavioral problems . His out-of- home placement in 2017 was intended as a temporary measure. During the out-of- home placement , however, the minor 's problems got worse; he has now stayed in three foster homes and he is currently staying with the Hoenderloo Group. In the first foster home the minor has stolen and set fire to. The mother acknowledges that the minor has problems, but she states that they are more manageable at her home and that she is better able to limit and support him than foster parents or other third parties. She has always participated in all assistance . Nevertheless, the GI has not worked on a replacement and the contact between the mother and the minor has even been sabotaged. It was decided too quickly that the minor 's perspective no longer lies with the mother . The mothertherefore does not see that the acceptable period stated in Article 1: 266 of the Dutch Civil Code would have expired. She further denies that there are any personal problems. The mother can offer the minor proper care and he can be treated as an outpatient by a psychiatrist .

At the hearing on appeal, the mother added to the foregoing that she lost her grip on the minor when he was still living with her, because the minor withdrew from her authority and the minor thereby found support with the father who was less strict with him then the mother .


5.3
The council has maintained its request for termination of the mother 's authority . In the case of the minor , there are multiple complex problems that, among other things, require an extremely neutral approach to his or her educator (s), without any influence from his own interests, for example where it comes to contact with the parents . Therefore, the minor 's perspective does not lie with the mother (or father ).


5.4
At the hearing on appeal, LJ&R stated that the minor was doing well until recently , both at school and in the Hoenderloo Group living group. the minor started playing football and in the group he got more and more liberties due to good behavior. He would like to go to a family home in the region where he lives, also to be closer to the father . The minor has been doing less well for a short time , namely since the father is in foreign detention in Rotterdam.


5.5
The documents show, among other things, that the minor has a long history of assistance , at least from September 2012 when he was also placed under supervision for a period of one year . According to the council report of 28 February 2018, there were concerns about behavior problems of the minor , his interaction with older children , bed wetting, parentification and attachment. Although the GI decided in June 2013 not to request an extension of the supervision order due to a positive development , the GI requestedalready in August 2013 for a custodial order and an emergency authorization for out-of- home placement , which requests were rejected by the juvenile court. In 2015, the minor started at the Oppoedpoli with the treatment of his behavioral problems. In 2016 the Opvoedpoli EMDR started and completed.

The request from the GI, leading to the custody and placement in custody mentioned under 3.2 , was submitted after an escalation between the minor and the mother , the mother being arrested by the police. There were also concerns about the unstable home situation. Because the mother could not adequately regulate her emotions , leading to verbal and physical aggression , there was unpredictability. the minor suffered from divorce problems , whereby the father expressed a negative opinion about the mother, resulting in behavioral problems in the minor and stagnation of his schooling.

the minor has had to change schools five to six times because of his behavioral problems. He also came into contact with the police several times.

After a few changes of residence , from August 2017 the minor stayed in a family home where he showed a positive development . From November 2017, however , the minor increasingly showed behavioral problems (intimidation, lying, scolding, not listening, aggression ), with the result that the minor was placed in the Hoenderloo Group in January 2018 because he needed more than a family home could offer .

According to the council report of 28 February 2018, the GZ psychologist associated with the Bascule has made PTSD as a highly probable diagnosis for the minor . His behavioral problems are based on a trauma caused by negative experiences, including psychological and emotional neglect.

The foregoing shows that, although assistance has been involved with the minor for a long time and various forms of assistance have been deployed for him (including by the mother ), his problems have increased not only when he was still living at home, but also in the foster family and in the family home, leading to dangerous situations for the minor and his environment .


5.6
In view of the problems outlined above, as well as the nature and duration thereof, the court and the court are of the opinion that the minor's development is seriously endangered . His problems are multiple and complex and make high demands on his educator (s); so high that the family home - which goes to court is equipped for children with behavioral problems - could not meet those requirements. It is therefore not to be expected that the mother will be able to assume responsibility for the care and upbringing of the minor within a minor acceptable period. The Hoenderloo Groep 's new individual plan for the minor of 21 December 2018 shows that the minor needs a predictable, reliable, stable and neutral environment . The documents in the file and the proceedings at the hearing show that the mother wants the best for the minor , but she has not always succeeded in creating a stable, predictable environment for the minor . In any case where the contact between the minor and the father is concerned, the mother cannot guarantee neutrality. Now, in the opinion of the court on the grounds of Article 1: 266, first paragraph, under a Civil Code are met, the court was correct and proper grounds the request of the Board seeking to terminate the authority of the mother assigned. The Court of Appeal will ratify the contested decision.

In the case with case number 200.247.234 / 01


5.7
Since the authority of the mother had already been terminated at the time of the adoption of the contested decision and LJ&R was entrusted with the guardianship of the minor , LJ&R - like the GI - is an interested party in the present case.


5.8
Pursuant to Section 1: 377a (2) of the Dutch Civil Code, the court lays down rules on the exercise of access rights at the request of the parents or of one of them or the person in close personal relationship with the child , whether or not for a fixed period . or deny whether or not for some time, the right to association .

Under 1: 377a paragraph 3, DCC denies the judge the right to association only if:

a. interaction would seriously harm the mental or physical development of

the child , or

b. the parent or the person in close personal relationship with the child must be deemed unsuitable or apparently unable to interact , or

c. the child who is twelve years or older , when he interrogates serious objections to interaction

with his parent or the person with whom he has a close personal relationship, or

d. handling is otherwise contrary to the child's compelling interests .


5.9
The mother argues that the GI has wrongly not worked on establishing contact between her and the minor . Whether or not intercourse takes place cannot be left entirely to the minor . It is necessary that an institution such as LJ&R takes the lead in this, putting the minor's interests first. The longer there is no contact , the harder it will be to re-establish that contact. The mother therefore does not agree with the court's consideration that it is too early to establish a visitation arrangement . There needs to be researchbe carried out according to the possibilities of interaction .

At the hearing on appeal, the mother added to the foregoing that she had made many attempts to resume contact with the minor ; she has traveled repeatedly to the Hoenderloo Group, she has sent and called letters, but without contact from LJ&R and the Hoenderloo Group there is no contact between the mother and the minor .


5.10
The documents and the proceedings at the hearing on appeal have shown that the minor did not want to see the mother since his placement in April 2017. Apart from chance encounters, there was no interaction for a long time . In November 2018 it became apparent that contact had again been made with the father . As the mother states, since August 2018 she has had contact with the minor every two weeks during the weekend . They also spent Christmas together. In January 2019 an incident took place between the mother and the father . the minor then did not want to contact the mother anymore , because he holds her responsible for the father being in foreign detention.


5.11
At the hearing on appeal , LJ&R indicated that the minor , just like when LJ&R was charged with guardianship of the minor on 30 May 2018 , certainly says that she does not want contact with the mother . At that time it turned out that he was in contact with the mother again , without the knowledge of the counseling . The contact will have to be built up again in the future with small steps.


5.12
The Court of Appeal finds that on the basis of the documents in the file, the proceedings at the hearing and the conversation with the minor himself, it is clear that the minor currently expressly does not want contact with the mother . LJ&R has recalled that the minor previously stated that he certainly did not want contact, but that contact has nevertheless been restored for some time. As discussed at the hearing, it must be assumed that a child of fourteen years old can, to a significant extent, only oversee the here and now; abstract questions about contact with the motherin the (near) future he still has to learn to answer. Together with the mother , the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that a decision about interaction cannot in principle be based solely on the opinion of the child . In this case, however, the minor has to contend with complex problems, as has already been considered in the case with case number 200.247.224 / 01. According to the new individual plan for the minor of 21 December 2018 from the Hoenderloo Group, part of the minor's problem is explained by the fact that he is with the motherexperienced unpredictability and insecurity at home. As a result, the relationship with the mother has become fraught. There were also escalations between the mother and the minor , leading to aggression and loss of contact. In those circumstances, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that there is currently no room for the minor to have access to the mother and that this is contrary to his weighty interests.

Like the court, the court sees no reason to have an investigation carried out into the possibilities of interaction between the minor and the mother , as requested by the latter. The finding of truth that the mother requires is not an end in itself for a (council) investigation. This does not alter the fact that the court expects that LJ&R and the Hoenderloo Groep will make more efforts than is currently the case to stimulate and, if possible, resume contact between the minor and the mother .

The conclusion is that the decision that will be appealed.


5.13
This leads to the following decision.

In the case with case number 200.247.224 / 01
