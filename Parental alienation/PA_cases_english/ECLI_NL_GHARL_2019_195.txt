2.2
The minor the minor1 (hereafter: the minor1), born in 2001, informed the court of appeal with regard to the request by letter of 18 September 2018.


2.3
The oral hearing took place on 19 October 2018. Parties have appeared in person, assisted by their lawyers.


3 The facts

3.1
The husband and wife are the parents of:

- the minor1 aforementioned, and

- the minor2 (hereafter: the minor2), born in 2003, over whom the woman exercises sole authority . The children have their main residence with the woman.


3.2
By order of 22 July 2009, the court, at the joint request of the parties, determined that the husband will pay € 200 per child per month as a contribution to the costs of care and upbringing of the minor1 and the minor2 from 20 June 2008 . A contribution of € 200 per child per month in 2008 is € 235.94 per child per month in accordance with the statutory indexation as of 1 January 2018 .


4 The scope of the dispute

4.1
The contested decision amended the decision of the court of 22 July 2009 in the sense that the man's contribution to the costs of care and upbringing (hereafter also: child support ) of the minor1 and the minor2 over the period of 1 January 2017 to January 1, 2018 is set to nil and that from January 1, 2018 the man must pay child support for the minor1 and the minor2 an amount of € 45 per child per month.


4.2
The woman appealed against the decision of with three complaints

1 February 2018 in so far as it concerns child support for the period from 1 January 2018. Grief I refers to the capacity of the man, complaint II refers to the capacity of the woman and complaint III refers to the capacity comparison . The woman requests that the order of 1 February 2018 be annulled (as the Court understands) insofar as it concerns child support for the period from 1 January 2018 and insofar as it is again justified, if necessary supplementing the grounds, to determine that the man is entitled to a monthly in the event of payment in advance from 1 January 2018, a contribution to the costs of care and upbringing of minor childrenmust pay an amount of € 158 for January, € 272 for February and € 227 from March 1, 2018, or at least child support to be paid by the man in such a way determine the amount to be determined by the court in good justice.


4.3
The man puts forward a defense and requests I) to reject the request of the woman on appeal and to uphold the decision of 1 February 2018 and II) to order the woman to pay the man's costs.


4.4
Ground III lacks independent meaning and will therefore not be discussed separately.


5 The reasons for the decision
With regard to the changes to the women's appeal


5.1
In a letter dated 9 October 2018, filed by a journal report dated 12 October 2018, the woman wrote that the minor1 had her main residence with the woman again from 7 September 2018 and that there was no interaction between the minor1 and the man. In connection with this change, the woman has argued that from September 2018 the man's share in the costs of the children amounts to € 324 per month, namely € 203 for the benefit of the minor1 and € 121 for the benefit of the minor2, if the man 's debts are not taken into account and € 285 per month, namely€ 184 for the minor1 and € 121 for the minor2, if the debts are taken into account .


5.2
At the hearing, the woman explained that she requested that the amounts as stated in the petition of her appeal - for the period up to 1 September 2018 - per child per month be determined for the aforementioned periods.


5.3
Pursuant to Articles 359 up to and including 361 in conjunction with Article 278 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the notice of appeal / defense, including incidental appeal, must contain the grounds on which it is based. This rule means that when defending an appeal, the defendant may in principle assume that the scope of the legal dispute on appeal is defined by the notice of appeal / defense, which also includes incidental appeals. It follows that, in principle, the court should disregard complaints that are raised at a later stage than in the notice of appeal / defense, which also includes an incidental appeal. This also applies to a change or increase in the request and to new defenses.


5.4
Exceptions to this, in principle, strict rule can only be accepted in certain circumstances, in particular if the other party has unambiguously agreed to the change or increase of the request taking place, or if the nature of the dispute means that such a change will occur at a later stage. whether propagation can take place. Furthermore, a change or increase after the taking of the two claims may generally be permissible if it is intended to adjust to facts and circumstances that have arisen or have emerged only after that time and that the change or increase is intended to prevent the dispute arising decisions (now outdated or incorrect (legal or factual) data should be decided), or that - if still possible - a new procedure should be instituted to enable the dispute to be decided on the basis of the correct and complete data. In that case, it remains unaffected that admission of the change or increase of the request may not conflict with the requirements of a proper procedural order.


5.5
Insofar as the woman has amended her request for appeal with regard to child support for the period from 1 September 2018 (by letter of 9 October 2018), the Court of Appeal considers that this change is permissible, since the reason for the adjustment of the request lies in the change in the relationship between the man and the minor after the notice of appeal1. It has not been found that this change to the request is contrary to the proper procedural order.


5.6
To the extent that the woman changed her appeal request at the hearing in the sense that the requested contributions per child over the period up to 1 September 2018the court must determine as follows: The man has expressly objected to the change in the woman's request, so that there is no question of unambiguous consent on the part of the man. Nor are there facts and circumstances that only occurred after the petition had been submitted. Although the nature of the (maintenance) proceedings means that, in principle, new complaints can be made to the oral hearing or an amendment to a request can be made, the Court of Appeal considers this change to the request contrary to the requirements of a good process order. In view of the debate between the appeal parties, the husband did not have to take into account such a change in the request of the appeal woman.to request children . Furthermore, a request from the woman that the amounts per child mentioned in the petitum, which she mentioned in the petitum , would not have been able to appeal in any case for the amount of € 272 because the woman did not have an independent request in the proceedings before the court submitted. A request for a higher amount than the applicable indexed child support (see paragraph 3.2) could not have been appealed for the first time, so that the husband did not have to have reason to suppose that the wife requested the amounts per child .

Child support

the starting date


5.7
The effective date of the change as of January 1, 2018 is not up for discussion. The court will therefore start from that date.

the needs of the children


5.8
The (joint) needs of the minor1 and the minor2 determined by the contested decision for 2018 at € 472 per month for the minor are not in dispute and have therefore been established.

the carrying capacity


5.9
In determining the man's share in the needs of the children , the capacity of all those subject to maintenance and the relationship between each person and the children must be taken into account in the assessment.


5.10
In view of what is considered under 5.7 with regard to the commencement date , the court will assess the financial capacity as from January 1, 2018.

regarding the man


5.11
The court has set the net disposable income of the man at € 2,904 per month. Now that no complaint has been made against this and the parties at the hearing have confirmed that the said amount can be assumed, the court will take this amount as the starting point.


5.12
It is disputed between the parties to what extent the man's debts with B, C and D must be taken into account .


5.13
The Court of Appeal stated first and foremost that, according to the established case law of the Supreme Court, all debts in principle affect the capacity of a debtor to pay maintenance, but that, if motivated, certain debts can be given less weight if appropriate. In line with this, in paragraph 7.2 of the Recommendations of the Expert maintenance standards stipulate that take into account (fixed) debts that are beyond the control and not avoidable, the capacity charge income in the strength formula increase.


5.14
The Court of Appeal is of the opinion that the man, in the light of the motivated dispute by the woman, has insufficiently substantiated the necessity of the existence of debts with B and C. The Court of Appeal takes into account that at the hearing it emerged that the man subsequently used the credits taken out in connection with his studies in particular for his livelihood and to be able to meet current payment obligations, including the tax authorities. . In the opinion of the man, he did not provide sufficient insight into the origin of the debts, so that the court of appeal cannot determine that there are non-culpable and unavoidable debts . The court will debts for B and C should therefore not be taken into account.


5.15
The Court of Appeal also sees no reason to take the debt with D into account. Apart from the fact that the man could have already repaid this debt, it appears from the documents and the hearing that the man has made use of the possibility to suspend the repayment of the debt at D (for five years).


5.16
The man finally argued that his attorney's fees should be taken into account. Lawyer costs incurred in the context of family law proceedings are generally not considered to be a necessary burden that takes precedence over the maintenance obligation, at least not for determining child support (see the Maintenance Standards Version 2018-1 report of the Maintenance Standards Expert Group ). Now that special circumstances on the basis of which this standard should be departed from have not been established, the Court of Appeal does not take attorney's fees into account.


5.17
In view of the above, the Court of Appeal assumes a man's capacity to pay 70% of (€ 2,904.00 (0.3 x € 2,904.00 + € 920)) has been rounded off € 779 per month (capacity table 2018) .

with regard to women


5.18
At the hearing, the parties agreed that - from 1 February 2018 - without taking into account possible income from business - a woman's capacity of € 126 per month should be taken into account because of the reduction in her income , so that the court will assume that. For reasons of efficiency, the court of January 2018 will also assume a woman's financial capacity of € 126 per month.


5.19
The man has also argued that the woman generates income from her company E. The woman disputed that claim and argued that, although she set up this company - a sewing workshop - in 2015, she did not perform any work in the company . The woman has stated that she has no creativity to carry out assignments and that she cannot concentrate. The woman has stated that she receives a benefit under the Sickness Benefits Act and receives help from a psychologistbecause of her complaints, including panic attacks and crying showers. A doctor has told her that she is unable to work with clients, the woman said. The woman also stated that she does not have any accounts, because her business did not get off the ground. She also argued that her accountant made a declaration last year and that she has a refund of € 152 in connection with the purchase of a sewing machine. According to the woman, the attacks over the previous years were nil. Now that the woman has substantiated the man's argument and the man has insufficiently substantiated his argument, the court ignores the man's claim that the woman receives income from business activities.enjoy. The Court of Appeal takes into account the above that the documents show that since May 2018 the woman has been receiving benefits under the Sickness Benefits Act. Insofar as the husband complains that the wife has not submitted any documents relating to her business , the Court of Appeal ignores that in view of the above considerations.

Capacity comparison


5.20
The joint needs of the minor1 and the minor2 amount to € 472 per month. The carrying capacity of the man and the woman together amounts to (€ 779 + 126 =) € 905 per month and is therefore sufficient to meet the needs of the children .


5.21
Compared to the capacity of the man and the woman, they (€ 779/905 x 472 = rounded) should use € 406 respectively (€ 126/905 x 472 = rounded) € 66 of their capacity for a contribution in the own share of the costs of the minor1 and the minor2.

Reduction with the care discount


5.22
It is not in dispute that a care discount of 35% is applied to the minor2 , or (€ 236 x 35% =) rounded off at € 83 per month. Nor is it disputed that a care discount of 35% is applied to the minor1 over the period from 1 January 2018 to 1 September 2018 .


5.23
The Court of Appeal is of the opinion that with effect from 1 September 2018 a minority care discount of 15% must be taken into account for the minor1 . Although it has been established between the parties that since 7 September 2018 the man has no longer had contact with the minor1, this does not automatically mean that the care discount is not taken into account because parents have the right and obligation to have contact with each other and towards the child . An exception to this could be the case if the man does not fulfill his obligation to interact . This has not been demonstrated. The court does not expect the co-parenting schemeas agreed by the parties can be resumed in the foreseeable future, but it is assumed that both parties will make an effort to restore contact between the minor1 and the man. Under these circumstances there is no reason to disregard the care discount completely, or to assume a care discount of 5%. With effect from 1 September 2018, the Court of Appeal will take a care discount of (rounded off) € 35 per month into account with regard to the minor1 .


5.24
The amount of the care discount is deducted in full from the amount that the man has to pay to the woman for the costs of care and upbringing , because the parents together have sufficient capacity to meet the needs of the children .

This means that for the man a contribution remains of (€ 203, - € 83, - =) € 120 per month with regard to the minor2 for the period from 1 January 2018 and with regard to the minor1 over the period from January 1, 2018 to September 1, 2018. For the period from September 1, 2018, the man has a contribution for the minor1 of (€ 203.- € 35.-) € 168.- per month.

Conclusion


5.25
The woman has requested a contribution to the costs of care and upbringing of the children for the month of January 2018 from € 158 per month, or € 79 per child per month, for the month of February 2018 € 272 per child . month, or € 136 per child per month and € 227 per month for the period from 1 March 2018 to 1 September 2018, or rounded off at € 114 per child per month. For the period from 1 September 2018, she requests a contribution for the benefit of the children of € 324 per month, namely € 203 for the minor1 and € 121 for the minor2 in the event that no account is taken is taken into account with the debtsfrom the man to B, C and D. These amounts constitute the upper limit of the dispute for the relevant periods.


5.26
The above means that the court will determine the contribution to the costs of care and upbringing of the minor1 and the minor2 for January 2018 at € 79 per child per month and for February 2018 at € 120 per child per month. For the period from 1 March 2018 to 1 September 2018, the court will determine the contribution to the costs of care and upbringing of the minor1 and the minor2 at € 114 per child per month. For the period from 1 September 2018, the Court of Appeal determines the contribution to the costs of care and upbringing of the minor1 at € 168 per month and the contribution to the costs of care and upbringing of the minor2 at € 120 per month.

Process costs


5.27
The Court of Appeal sees in what the man has submitted no reason to order the woman to pay the costs of the proceedings, as requested by the man. Partly in view of the outcome of the dispute, the Court of Appeal will compensate the costs of the proceedings on appeal, now that the parties have had a relationship with each other and the proceedings concern the contribution to the children born from that relationship .


6 The conclusion
In view of the foregoing, the Court of Appeal will annul the contested decision, as far as subject to its judgment, and decide as follows.


7 The decision
The court, having an appeal:

set aside the order of the Midden-Nederland District Court, location Almere, of 1 February 2018, to the extent that it is subject to the judgment of the court, and in so far as it has again:

stipulates that the man will pay to the woman over the month of January 2018 as a contribution to the costs of care and upbringing of the minor1, born in 2001, and the minor2, born in 2003, € 79 per child per month, over the February 2018 120, - per child per month for the period of March 1, 2018 to september 1, 2018 € 114, - per child per month;

stipulates that the man will pay the woman over the period from 1 September 2018 as a contribution to the costs of care and upbringing of the minor1 € 168 per month, to pay the future installments in advance each time in advance;
