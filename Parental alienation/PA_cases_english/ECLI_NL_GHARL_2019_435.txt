5 The reasons for the decision

5.1
It is up to the court to judge the decisions of the court regarding the minor 's place of residence3 and the authority over the minor1, the minor2 and the minor3. The guardian ad litem concluded in its reports on August 27, 2018 that there are insufficient grounds for the principal residence advised to change and monarchical authority to the mother to leave. The Court of Appeal sees reason to first consider the authority , since this is the most far-reaching decision.

Authority over the minor1, the minor2 and the minor3 (case number 200.239.520 / 01)


5.2
On appeal, the court of appeal must ex nunc review the father's request , which means that he requests that the joint authority of the parents over the children be maintained, that is to say based on the current situation and the facts and circumstances as they currently occur and are known to the court. Among other things, the following has emerged about this. The father has not seen the minor2 since the beginning of 2017 and the minor1 and the minor3 have not seen since the end of 2017. In December 2017, the father also left GI and since then there has been no contact between thefather and the GI . The father only wants to talk to the GI on the condition that he can discuss his concerns about the safety of the children at the mother's home. The GI is willing to listen to the concerns of the father and to discuss this with him, but the GI also wants to discuss the concerns that the GI has about the father with him. The father does not seem open to this. As a result, the GI failed to talk to the father. The father did not appear at the hearing on appeal. At the moment, little is known about the current situation of the father . It is certain that the children seriously in their development are threatened . They are charged with loyalty issues and adult issues, where assistance is also stagnating. Now that there has been no proper communication between the father and the mother nor between the father and the GI for some time , the father hassufficiently demonstrated how he currently or in the foreseeable future the parent joint agreements about the kids want to come and how he wants to otherwise shape the implementation of joint custody . The Court of Appeal also takes into account that the father stated during the investigation of F, as is clear from the F report of 25 September 2017, that he cannot handle contacts with the mother and cannot cooperate with her. However, this is a necessary requirement for the proper exercise of the joint saw. F also concludes that the father is the motherin no way seems to be able to tolerate and that he disqualifies the mother in both her mother role and her as a person.

In addition, it emerged from the documents and the proceedings at the hearing that joint authority has led to problems several times in the past. For example, assistance for the children has stagnated and it took about half a year before the change of school was arranged for the minor1.

Moreover, revealed that since the mother by order of February 20, 2018 with the monarchical authority is responsible, for the children needed assistance started. The Court of Appeal considers it of great importance that this assistance can be continued in a constructive manner and therefore also believes that the contested decision in which the mother is given sole authority over the minor1, the minor2 and the minor3 should be upheld. stay.


5.3
The above considerations show that the court ignores the father 's propositions . The father has argued that the reason for the appeal that he brought was mainly due to the fact that for years he had been seriously concerned about the safety of the children at the mother's home and that he was not heard in his concerns. He therefore feels that he has to shout more and more or do something else to get the attention.

The Court of Appeal finds that the care of the father has been recognized in recent years by various care providers and the Court also endorses these concerns, insofar as they relate to the past.

The court alone does not follow the father in his statement that nothing has been done with his worries. The court has the impression that, due to everything that has happened in the past, the father is no longer able to see positive developments in the children and in the situation of the mother . Because of the identified concerns and the consequent serious threat to the development of the children , the children have also been placed under supervision and there is help in a forced context. The court is different than on behalf of thefather has been argued, it has not been shown that the mother is withholding assistance . At the hearing she stated, and this has been confirmed by the GI, that she receives help from G once or twice a week at home. the minor1 and the minor3 receive four hours of guidance each week from a personal supervisor , the minor3 also goes to a care farm a number of times a month and the minor2 receives guidance from a coach. In addition, the care signals given by the school about the children are also picked up by the GI and the social services. There are therefore various professional bodies involved that closely monitor the safety of the children . The Court of Appeal is of the opinion that the safety of the children is sufficiently guaranteed with this assistance . The argument put forward by the father about the concerns about the children in the home situation with the mother does not lead to a different opinion.


5.4
For the sake of completeness, the court considers as follows. The current term of supervision is due to expire in June 2019. The GI noted at the hearing that it is currently of the opinion that the assistance will no longer have to be provided in a forced context. The court doubts - even now that the mother is solely responsible for the custody of the children - whether assistance in a voluntary context is sufficient. After all, at the moment there is no proper interaction between the father and the children and also the information provided by the motherthe father with regard to the children is not yet without problems. Moreover, with regard to the mother there has been a very delicate balance between her carrying capacity and carrying capacity for a longer period of time . By stopping the contact with the father , the mother currently only takes care of the children . As the minor1 and the minor2 need extra care, this has consequences for the mother 's ability to pay . The court reminds the father that the motherat the hearing stated that - rendered concisely - she finds it regrettable that the father does not currently take care of the children . The children miss the father and the mother hopes that the father will return to the children 's lives .

The principal residence of the minor3 (case number 200.234.833 / 01)


5.5
In view of the above decision on custody , the father no longer has an interest in his request to determine the minor 's principal place of residence3 with him. The court of appeal will therefore reject the request of the father on appeal and ratify the contested decision, to the extent that it is subject to the judgment of the court of appeal. For the sake of completeness, the court considers as follows. The Court also sees no reason to determine in what the father put forward in support of his request that the minor3 is the only one of the three children who has his principal place of residence with the fathermust have. the minor3, as well as the minor1 and the minor2, have, since the cessation of co-parenting at the end of 2017, lived fully - and for that time already for several years every other week - with the mother . There has therefore been a lasting situation for quite some time.


5.6
Finally, the Court wishes to state the following. It is now up to the father in the interests of the children and acceptance of the role of the parent as authoritative parent occupies in the lives of children working with the GI to go where possible ties with his children to recover and to intensify. The court reminds the father that the minor1 has also indicated to the court that she misses her father , wants to see him and wants to receive (more) tickets from him. the minor2 has stated that he is open to assisted interactionwith the father . The guardian ad litem has advised in this regard - and the Court endorses this advice - that, if possible, a conversation should first be organized between the minor2, the father and the coach of the minor2, so that the issues that bothers the minor2 can be discussed and the supervised intercourse can be well prepared, so that the minor2 is not again disappointed: in this context, the father must move with the wishes of the minor2. At the hearing, the father 's lawyer offered to go with the father , the GIand any other stakeholders involved to sit down and talk to each other about current problems and concerns. The Court hopes that this conversation will actually take place and that this will offer an opening for contact recovery between the father and the children and will result in positive developments .
