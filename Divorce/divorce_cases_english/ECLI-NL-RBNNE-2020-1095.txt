1 Proceedings
1.1.
In her application, [applicant] requested the court, among other things, to provisionally change the parental plan that is part of the divorce decision of the District Court of Overijssel of 2 October 2017 with regard to provisional provision within the meaning of Art. of the care scheme.

1.2.
[defendant] has lodged a defense.

1.3.
The case was heard in the presence of parties and their lawyers at the hearing on 3 February 2020.

1.4.
The court took note of the letter with appendices, received on January 31, 2020, from [applicant].

2 Facts

2.1.
The parties have had a registered partnership, which was dissolved on 2 October 2017 by the Overijssel court. From the relationship of the parties, the [minor] was born on [date of birth] 2016 in the [municipality].

2.2.
Parties have drawn up a parenting plan. They have agreed that [the minor] will be registered at the address with [respondent]. With regard to the distribution of care and upbringing duties, they have, according to the provisions in 7.1. of the parenting plan opted for co-parenting, based on the principle that [the minor] is with one parent about half the time and the other half of the time with the other parent. What they consider important in this respect is good communication and cooperation and a place of residence close to each other. They have entered the distribution as follows. [the minor] is with [the applicant] for six out of a fortnight, spending two consecutive nights with her once every fortnight. They will distribute the holidays equally and fairly.

2.3.
Parties currently live together. At the hearing, the parties stated that they would implement the care scheme in accordance with the aforementioned agreements, with the exception of the distribution of the holidays. In consultation they deviate from the fourteen-day rule, with the exception of overnight stays, which are never more than two consecutive.

3 Appeal

3.1.
[applicant] has stated that it has an interest in a provisional provision for the duration of the main proceedings, now that [defendant] cuts off any conversation concerning a change in the care scheme, while there are changed circumstances that in the opinion of [applicant] require a change.

3.2.
On behalf of [defendant] it has been argued that an interim relief procedure is not suitable for examining the request for an extension of the care scheme.

3.3.
Pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 223 DCCP, any party may, during a pending proceedings, demand that the court make an interim injunction for the duration of the proceedings. Pursuant to the second paragraph, this claim must be related to the main claim. In a petition procedure, a provisional measure can be requested by analogy with Article 223 DCCP (Supreme Court, 5 December 2014, ECLI: NL: HR: 2014: 3533). It should be noted that the provision under Article 223 DCCP is a disciplinary measure. It concerns a provisional provision and a provisional opinion. In this sense, the applicant should have an interest in the claim / provision that he cannot be expected to await the outcome of the case.

3.4.
It has already been established that a main action is pending in this court, so that the first paragraph of Article 223 DCCP is satisfied. It has also been shown that the request made by [applicant] is related to the main claim, now that both concern changes to the care scheme. This fulfills the condition set in the second paragraph of Article 223 DCCP. Finally, it must be assessed whether [applicant] has an (urgent) interest in taking a provisional measure. On the basis of what has been argued for this, in particular that - contrary to what [the defendant] claims - it concerns a request to change the care scheme and not a request for extension, the age of [the minor] and a decision pending [applicant] cannot be deprived of a sufficient interest in the handling of the case and in anticipation that [the minor] goes to school. The court will therefore proceed to deal with the substance of the request.

3.5.
In support of her request, [applicant] stated that the current care scheme was established as it was established due to the age of [the minor], at the time just 1 year old, the fact that she did not yet have suitable accommodation and her health situation. Conditions have changed since then. [the minor] is now almost 3.5 years old, [the applicant] has had suitable accommodation near the house of [the defendant] for some time and she has been operated on and eventually recovered from it. She no longer has any physical limitations. There is currently no longer any need for [the minor] to spend the night with [defendant] almost every night. There are ten change times for [the minor] every fortnight. [applicant] considers this too much, given his age. This makes him restless and it may very well explain what [the defendant] states, namely that [the minor] is very much attached to her. [applicant] has indicated that she wants more rest in the care scheme for [the minor]. In the provisional provisions procedure, she is not talking about a week-by-week care plan, but about a change in care plan whereby [the minor] stays with her for a maximum of four days in a row. She has already several times addressed to [respondent] that she wants an amendment to the care scheme whereby [the minor] spends the night with her more often. In support of her claim that she has requested this, she refers to the email messages submitted and the WhatsApp messages about this. She states that there is no entrance at [defendant] to discuss this. [Applicant] is of the opinion that her health status does not pose a problem for the changed access arrangements, just as it never has been a problem if [respondent] asked her to take extra care for [the minor].

3.6.
[defendant] stated that [applicant] never asked for a different interpretation of the care scheme. According to [respondent], she wants a different care scheme because she feels misunderstood as a parent. [defendant] states at the hearing that she has been clear from the start about her wish that [the minor] start his day from his bed at her home. She believes that it is better for young children to go to the other parent more frequently and shorter. She further stated that [the minor] is very dependent on her when he returns from [applicant]. [defendant] has indicated that before wanting to change the care scheme, she first wants to talk to [mediator] with [applicant]. She would then like to discuss the care scheme, but also the taxability of [applicant]. When asked, [defendant] indicates that she believes that [the minor] thrives in the current arrangement and that nothing should be changed.

4 Reasons of the Decision
3.7.
The court considers that the parties agreed in 2017 that they wanted to implement a co-parenting arrangement. It follows from the text of the parenting plan that, in spite of what the defendant's lawyer argued about this at the hearing, the parties envisaged dividing the care and upbringing duties by about 50/50. The distribution has also always been close to 50/50, except for overnight stays. In this procedure, the [applicant] has requested a change in the distribution, not an extension, on the understanding that [the minor] will stay with her more often. That [the minor] currently spends only two nights of the fourteen nights with [the applicant] was agreed at the time because he was only one year old at the time of the parties' separation, [the applicant] did not have suitable accommodation and this corresponded to the wish of [defendant]. According to her statement at the hearing, [defendant's] wishes have not changed, but the circumstances have.

3.8.
The court finds that it is generally accepted that more frequent and shorter contacts with the non-caring parent are better for very young children (babies) than longer contacts in a row. In the present case, however, the parties have agreed to share the care and parenting tasks. There is no question of a primary caregiver and [applicant] has always had care and upbringing duties on six of the fourteen days. These were all days, so no short contacts. [the minor] is now almost 3.5 years old. The court has no indications that there is something wrong with [the minor], which, unlike other children of his age, could not spend the night with the other parent for more than two consecutive nights. In both family situations, there are no concerns about [the minor]. That it is too burdensome for [the minor] to spend three or four nights in a row with [applicant] is an interpretation of [defendant] based on his adherence to her. However, he has never slept with [applicant] more than two nights in a row. In the opinion of the court for a child of 3.5 years, the number of transition times in the current care scheme is considerable and this applies all the more from the moment he starts school. In addition, in the opinion of the court, more nights spent at [the applicant] will do more justice to the principle of sharing the care and upbringing duties between the parties. The court considers it important that [the minor] may experience that he also has a bed with [the applicant] and that both parents can also support this. This creates a more equal distribution of parenthood and that is also important for the development of [the minor]. Furthermore, the court has no grounds to suppose that [applicant] requested an unrealistic provisional care scheme with her request. A care scheme that would not be possible for her because of her health is illogical. Furthermore, the court does not understand why a disabled parent can take care of a child during the day and not at night.

3.9.
In view of the above, the court sees reason to temporarily change the care scheme for an intermediate phase in the run-up to the moment that [the minor] goes to school and pending the main proceedings. Then it can also be discussed how the care scheme for [the minor] went. The court will determine that [the minor] will stay with [the applicant] from Saturday 6.30 pm to Tuesday 6.30 pm in the one week and take him to the childminder on Tuesday the other week from 6.30 pm until [applicant]. The court is of the opinion that this regulation does justice to the total care and upbringing duties by [applicant], which do not change, and to reduce the number of exchange moments for [the minor] and on the other hand (somewhat) satisfies the objection from [respondent] that [the minor] cannot spend the night with another person than her, since the number of consecutive nights does not exceed three.

3.10.
Finally, the court suggests that the parties discuss matters with each other for the duration of the provisional arrangement, for example with a mediator or with the Knowledge Center for Child and Divorce (KKE) about the care arrangements in the future. Parties can obtain a referral from their GP for the KKE. Finally, she instructs the parties to discuss in any interviews how [the minor] responds to the changed care scheme, whereby it is important that they do not give their own interpretation of their behavior and that they give [the minor] time to get used to the new scheme.

3.11.
The court will not determine a separate regulation for the holidays in the context of the interim relief procedure. Based on submitted copies of Whatsapp conversations, the court has established that the parties generally communicate respectfully and well with each other (deviation from the established care scheme is mutually possible) and it is confident that the parties can mutually agree on the holidays, in which she considers that the provisional care arrangement, as set out below in the operative part, should be the starting point.
