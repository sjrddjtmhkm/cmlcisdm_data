3 Scope of Dispute
4.1.
In the contested decision, the husband's request to amend the decision of 27 October 2015 (and the court also adopts the agreement concluded between the parties on 2 October 2015) and to set the partner maintenance to zero as of 1 October 2018, turned down.

The man requested that, by order, as far as practicable in stock, be set aside, the contested decision should be annulled and, again, as follows:

1) to amend the order of the court of Oost-Brabant dated 27 October 2015, as well as the underlying agreement dated 2 October 2015, in that the contribution to the maintenance of the woman as of 1 October 2018, at least for a the date that the court deems correct is set at nil, or at least an amount that the court deems correct;

2) to determine that the woman is obliged to repay to the man all that she has collected on the man since October 1, 2018 by virtue of the order of the maintenance obligation of the man under the order of the court of East Brabant of October 27, 2015. as well as to determine that the woman is obliged to reimburse the man's execution costs charged to him from 1 October 2018.

4.3.
The woman has requested that the man's appeal be declared unfounded.

The woman has also requested, by way of a (conditional) independent request, to determine if the court is of the opinion that there has been a change in circumstances and the spousal maintenance needs to be recalculated, to increase the spousal maintenance and to establish this. at € 6,300 per month as of the submission of the independent request, or as of the decision of the decision to be made by the court.

4.4.
In her independent request, the man has requested that the woman be declared inadmissible or that the request be rejected as unfounded and unproven.

4 Reasons of the Decision
Change of circumstances

5.1.
The following has emerged from the documents and the proceedings for oral hearing. The man was employed by [Hogescholen] Hogescholen as a teacher of game technique. In mid-October 2017, the man reported sick. From his first day of illness, the man received his full salary, including sick pay, of € 4,735.74 gross per month. In mid-October 2018, the salary / sick pay was reduced by 30% to € 3,321.02 gross per month. As of mid-October 2019, the man has a WIA benefit. The man has been declared 69.70% incapacitated for work, as shown in the letter of 27 September 2019 from the UWV to the man, and he will receive a benefit of € 3,057.62 gross per month as of mid-October 2019.

In view of the above, the Court of Appeal considers that there are multiple changes of circumstances, for the first time as of mid-October 2018. The foregoing means that the man's request to change spousal maintenance can be assessed. .

With regard to the (conditional) independent request of the woman on appeal

5.2.
Now that the woman has only put up a defense in the proceedings at first instance against the request of the husband, the self-employed (counter) request of the woman on appeal concerns a request that she makes for the first time on appeal, which in view of the provisions of Article 362 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Rv) in connection with Article 282 paragraph 4 Rv is not possible. The court will declare the woman inadmissible in her request.

Regarding the appeal of the man on appeal

starting date

5.3.
The husband has requested that the spousal maintenance be changed with effect from 1 October 2018. The court considers that the woman will in all fairness commence with effect from 21 September 2018, being the date on which the husband has submitted his change request to the court, or at least with effect from of 1 October 2018, has been able to take into account changes in spousal maintenance, so that the Court of Appeal reasonably sets the starting date of the spousal maintenance to be changed below on 1 October 2018.

Height of woman's need

5.4.1.
The amount of the need is in dispute between the parties. During the oral hearing, the woman's lawyer stated that the woman with the salary she has received from [Colleges] since 23 September 2019 of € 2,160.32 net per month, plus holiday allowance and an end-of-year bonus, on her own subsistence. can foresee. In view of this, it is no longer in dispute that the woman can in any case fully provide for her living from September 23, 2019, at least until July 31, 2020, the date on which the temporary employment will in principle end.

The question then only remains whether the woman still had (additional) needs over the period from 1 October 2018 to 23 September 2019 and after 31 July 2020, based on a need of the woman in accordance with her current salary at [Colleges]. . has on a living contribution.

Need of women

5.5.1.
The husband is of the opinion that for the period from October 1, 2018 to September 23, 2019, the woman can provide for her own subsistence, at least that she has made insufficient efforts to provide for her own subsistence and that the woman can in any case be considered to provide for her own livelihood.

Even after July 31, 2020, the woman must be considered to be able to support herself. The woman's temporary employment with [Hogescholen] may be extended and if this is not the case, the woman should be able to find a new employment with income such that she can support herself.

The woman has contested the statements of the man with motivation.

5.5.2.
The court considers the following.

5.5.2.1. In determining the need, in accordance with the provisions of Article 1: 157 of the Dutch Civil Code (BW), it must be assessed whether the woman does not have sufficient income and cannot reasonably obtain it, in order to support herself. to provide. Maintenance is a temporary financial safety net. The woman can be expected to make every effort to provide for her own living. The woman has an effort obligation on that point. The parties have agreed in the mutual arrangement of October 2, 2015: “As it stands, the woman will have to undergo two more operations on her hands. After all necessary operations have been performed and the woman has been repaired / rehabilitated, the woman intends to generate income herself in order to be able to (partly) provide for her own living ”, which is in line with the statutory regulation.

5.5.2.2. The following has emerged from the documents and the proceedings for oral hearing. The woman, now 61, has an education at university / master's level. It has not been stated nor has it been shown that the woman has physical or mental limitations to perform work, other than as a makeup artist. During the marriage of the parties, at least until 2008, the woman in vocational education worked as a teacher and educationalist, among others at [Hogescholen] Hogescholen. After that, the woman took a make-up course out of interest. The medical data submitted by the woman at first instance (Exhibit 9 to her petition for interim relief) show that the woman underwent a number of medical procedures on her hands in the period from 14 May 2013 to 21 January 2015. not proven.

The woman stated that from 2015 she applied to come to work, which the husband argued with motivation. The court finds that the woman of the alleged applications did not provide any verification information, at least not until the year 2018, which would have been her way, given the motivated dispute by the man. The woman has only submitted a letter from the [College], which shows that a temporary employment of the woman ended on March 1, 2018. It concerned substitute work, but the woman did not provide relevant information such as duration, salary and the like. Contrary to the existence of this temporary employment, it did not become apparent until 2018 that the woman made (sufficient) efforts to generate an income with which she could and could provide for her own subsistence. This is all the more urgent now that the women did apply in 2018 and 2019, and in particular after submitting the request of the man at first instance, as evidenced by the productions submitted by the woman, (more) started to apply and she, with a relatively limited number of effort (the woman has written only ten letters of application over the two-year period) and joined [Hogescholen] within a relatively short period of time at a salary with which the woman, as stated by the woman's lawyer for oral hearing, in her can make a living.

The court is of the opinion that the woman should be expected to have entered the labor market at an earlier stage and also on a larger scale than has been shown in this procedure, given her obligation to make an effort, and should have endeavored to do so that at least as of October 1, 2018 she could have provided her own livelihood. Now that the woman has failed to do this, or at least has not shown otherwise, she has not fulfilled her obligation to make an effort.

In view of the foregoing, the woman has no need for a contribution from the husband to support her as of October 1, 2018: for the period from October 1, 2018 to September 23, 2019, the woman is expected to provide for her own maintenance. and as of September 23, 2019, the woman actually provides for her own livelihood.

The woman has stated that the employment at [Colleges] as of September 23, 2019 is a temporary employment and that there is no certainty whether she can keep this job after July 31, 2020, but the court considers that the woman is also considered after July 31, 2020 in provide for her own livelihood. The court assumes that if she is unable to keep her job at [Colleges], in view of her education and work experience and her successful application experiences in the period 2018/2019, the woman should be considered capable, especially if she applies intensively to find another job with an income that she can support herself. In any case, the woman will have to make sufficient efforts to achieve this.

In view of the above, the court will set the partner's maintenance payments to zero from 1 October 2018.

5.6.
The court will not be able to assess the man's ability to pay.

Refund

5.7.1.
The woman has stated that the man has never paid the indexation for the year 2018 and that from November 2018 the man only paid an amount of € 1,093.50 per month in respect of partner maintenance, instead of the indexed € 2,204.55 per month. In November 2018, the woman engaged the LBIO who took up the collection of the partner's maintenance. From the production 11 submitted by the woman on appeal, it appears that until 1 July 2019 the man was still in arrears of € 5,344.

The man has stated that in June 2019 the parties made a temporary arrangement for the period from 1 July 2019 to suspend the execution, pending the appeal, on the condition that the man gives € 1,700 per month to the woman. would suffice. The man has stated that he has complied with that arrangement until January 2020. After the woman gave an (anonymous) payslip to the man in December 2019 at the request of the man, the man stopped paying spousal maintenance.

5.7.2.
With regard to the repayment, the court distinguishes two periods: the period from 1 October 2018 to 23 September 2019 and the period from 23 September 2019.

Covering the period from October 1, 2018 to September 23, 2019

5.7.2.1. Over this entire period, whether or not in consultation with the woman, the husband has paid less spousal maintenance than to which the woman was entitled at that time under the divorce decision and under the contested decision. On the other hand, the woman did not actually have her own labor income that she is currently expected to generate as of 1 October 2018. The court is of the opinion that the woman should not reimburse the husband's spousal maintenance paid by the husband over the period from 1 October 2018 to 23 September 2019 now that the paid spousal maintenance is deemed to have been spent for the purpose for which it was paid.

As of September 23, 2019

5.7.2.2. The court is of the opinion that the woman should reimburse the husband's alimony paid by the man after September 23, 2019. It is now established that as of 23 September 2019, the woman can provide for her own subsistence with her salary from [Colleges], so that the woman no longer needs partner maintenance. The Court of Appeal considers it reasonable and fair for the woman to reimburse the husband's alimony paid from 23 September 2019. It has not been shown that the woman is financially incapable of repayment. The income tax assessment 2017 submitted by the woman showed that in 2017 the woman had assets in box III of € 45,000. The fact that the woman has consumed that capacity, as she has argued, has contradicted the man with motivation, while the woman has not substantiated, at least not sufficiently substantiated, her position, which would have been her way.

The man has still requested reimbursement of the execution costs, but, apart from the fact that the man has not indicated the amount involved, the court is of the opinion that, now that the woman had the right to go to execution on the basis of the applicable court order, this request must be rejected.

5.8.
The foregoing leads to the following decision
