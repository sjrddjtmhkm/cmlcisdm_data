1 Proceedings

1.1.
The course of the procedure can be seen from:

the interim judgment of April 22, 2020;

the deed containing the submission of exhibits also increasing the requirement of March 10, 2020;

the exhibits (1 to 11) submitted by [defendant 1] of 10 March 2020;

the official report of the hearing of 10 March 2020.

1.2.
Finally, judgment has been determined.

2 Facts
2.1.
[Claimant 1], [Defendant 1] and [Defendant 2] were born from the marriage between [testator] (hereinafter: testator) and [mother]. That marriage was divorced on May 15, 1986.

2.2.
On 31 December 1990, the testator married under marital conditions to [name 1] (hereinafter: [name 1]).

2.3.
The testator died on February 28, 2009. The testator most recently left his estate by will of November 6, 2008. In that will, the provisions of the previous will of December 31, 1990 are maintained. According to that last will, testator has appointed [claimant 1], [defendant 1] and [defendant 2] as his only heirs. The deceased has the right to occupy [name 1] for a period of up to three years after the death of the house at [the house] 189-7 in Groningen (hereinafter: the house). In addition, testator has left [name 1] the life-long usufruct of NLG 150,000.00, to be increased by the average price index of household consumption. Finally, [name 1] was left with the usufruct of the deceased's estate, insofar as the household contents are actually used for this.

2.4.
In the will of 6 November 2008, the testator instituted a settlement regime over the estate for a maximum period of five years after the death of the testator, whereby [defendant 1] was appointed executor and resolution administrator. In that will, among other things, it is stated:

EXECUTOR AND RESOLUTION OPERATOR

In order to enable my son [defendant 1] to effect a division of my estate, in this case settling the estate, I establish a settlement regime over my estate and appoint him as executor and resolution administrator with the most extensive powers. This regime was instituted by me in the common interest of my heirs. The settlement regime set up by me gives my son [defendant 1] the power to independently (possibly partial) distribute my estate, without cooperation / permission, within two years after the day that my estate has become vacant, as the representative of my heirs. / authorization / approval of any kind. The regime ends at the latest five years after my death.

[…]

Account and accountability

The executor is obliged to report to my heirs at the end of his management. He provides the heirs with an annual statement of the income and costs relevant to taxation. '

2.5.
[Claimant 1], [Defendant 1] and [Defendant 2] have purely accepted the estate. [Defendant 1] has accepted his duties as executor and resolution administrator.

2.6.
At the time of his death, the deceased's estate included the shares in the company Fridina Holding B.V, a current account debt to Fridina Holding B.V., the home and the balance of a bank account.

2.7.
On April 26, 2012, [Defendant 1] sent an email to [Claimant 1] and [Defendant 2], in which he wrote among others:

'Rental or sale of the apartment to the [the house] 189-7:

Based on the will, [name 1] was allowed to live in the apartment for free for 3 years. I also preferred that the apartment be sold exclusively afterwards. However, the Netherlands was hit by the credit crisis at the end of 2009 (six months after the death of his father). This crisis has led to a complete stagnation in house sales.

[…]

The apartment will go on sale in the spring of 2013 in the hope that the Netherlands will have recovered somewhat from the now severe housing market crisis. The lease will then continue for another year and [name 1] will of course cooperate with the viewings as laid down in the lease. A house that is neatly inhabited has a better starting position for sale than an empty object.

[…]

Financial Overview

After deduction of the costs, the entire proceeds from the sale of the business premises in Nijverdal were transferred to the heirs' account (€ 365,000.00).

This is / are met:

Mortgage repayment [the home] € 100,000.00

Commutation of usufruct of money [name 1] € 31,200.00

Advance payment [claimant 1] € 55,832.00

Advance [defendant 1] € 55,832.00

Claim due to pension obligation € 76,853.00

The balance in the savings account in the name of the heirs is currently € 419,645.00. After deduction of the above amounts, a balance remains of € 99,928.00. For additional costs, a reservation of € 45,028.00 is required. Then there remains an amount of € 54,900.00 which can be divided equally among the three heirs.

In other words, the advance is split into two parts. A first part to ensure that the acquisition of you and me is aligned with the loan / advance of [defendant 2]. In this way, this loan / advance from [defendant 2] is nullified by offsetting with his inheritance.

Then all three of us can receive an amount of € 18,300.00, provided that you do not take any further steps against the two-year lease and agree to this distribution and the surrender of the usufruct of the money.

I look forward to your response. ”

2.8.
The (then) lawyer of [Claimant 1] acted on the previous email on 6 June 2012. In that email you can read:

The executor offers under three conditions that an amount of € 18,300 will be paid to all heirs.

The first condition is that no steps are taken against the rental. This is complied with, the other heirs rest in the rental of the apartment to [the house] 189-7 for a period of two years to Ms [name 1].

The second condition is that the other heirs agree with the provisional distribution added up by the executor, as is apparent from his email of 26 April 2012. I have included the overview, taken from the email in question, below.

[…]

On the basis of the documents currently available, the other heirs consider it plausible that [Defendant 1] had a debt to his father. For the time being, they will assume an obligation of € 55,832 to the estate, until further evidence may indicate a different size. They also accept that their father's current account debt to the B.V. - based on currently available documents - should be set at € 76,853.

The third condition is that the other heirs agree to the surrender of the usufruct of the sum of money. The other heirs agree to buy off this usufruct. It should be noted that they are currently unable to check whether the lump sum payment has been correctly calculated, partly because they lack data. Could you provide me with the calculation of the lump sum payment with a brief explanation?

The executor's letter also shows that he has reserved an amount of € 45,028 for 'extra costs'. The other heirs understand that a reservation must be kept for possible costs. Perhaps unnecessarily, I would like to point out that before they agree to the costs incurred, they first want to take note of a specified final statement.

I conclude that the parties are now aligned in almost all areas, which I believe contributes to the speedy settlement of this estate. At present there is no intention to take legal action with the other heirs. The conditions stated by the executor for payment of an advance to the heirs of € 18,300 are met. Can you confirm to me that the executor will transfer these advances in the near future? "

2.9.
The property was sold on February 1, 2016 for an amount of € 310,000.00. After deduction of certain costs, the sales proceeds amounted to € 303,625.32.

2.10.
The creditors of [defendant 2] seized the notary on (his share in) the proceeds from the sale. ABN Amrobank paid an amount of € 71,223.72 to Van Arkel Bailiffs & Incasso for an enforceable third-party attachment and an amount of € 23,984.72 was transferred to the bailiff's office Achthoek for a precautionary third-party seizure by the [name 4]. In total, therefore, 1/3 of the amount of € 303,625.32 has been paid to creditors of [defendant 2].

2.11.
[Defendant 1] sent an email to [Claimant 1] on February 8, 2016, in which he wrote among other things:

'Last Monday the transfer of the [the house] 189-7 took place. Fortunately, this went well.

You will find the invoice of the invoice enclosed.

The 1/3 part (the share of [defendant 2]) went directly to the bailiff.

The remainder has been transferred to the heirs' account. Your share therein is € 101,208.44.

I have now transferred € 70,000 to your bank account.

As you know, Fridina Holding BV has a pension provision and there is a claim of the Holding on the heirs.

In connection with this, a repayment of € 25,000 (total € 50,000) has been booked for both of us in favor of the debt of the heirs. This amount has been deducted from your share.

This is necessary in order to be able to meet the lifelong pension obligation.

Furthermore, I still miss the sales proceeds in accordance with submission invoice Auction 129,

entry number 2875 (Omnia Auction House) of 20 October 2014 (also included) for an amount of € 3,151.75.

This amount was transferred elsewhere in accordance with your order and has still not returned to the heirs account. It is completely unclear to me where this money has gone.

In anticipation of the auction proceeds mentioned above, you will therefore soon receive the following amount: € 101,208.44 - / - € 70,000 (already transferred) - / - partial repayment of debt to heirs € 25,000 - / - auction proceeds as described above € 3,151.75 = € 3,056.69. I have prepared this amount for you today.

Furthermore, I hereby inform you that I will soon draw up a complete overview of the inheritance.

2.12.
[Defendant 1] paid a total of € 73,056.69 to [Claimant 1] in respect of the proceeds from the sale of the property.

2.13.
On 4 June 2018, the attorney of [Claimant 1] sent a letter to [Defendant 1], including:

“First of all, I would like to point out that the sale of the apartment at 189-7 in Groningen. From the settlement note from the notary public 't Sydevelt dated 1 February 2016, it appears that the sale proceeds of the apartment amounted to € 303,625.32. This proceeds will go to the heirs, namely: your brother [defendant 1], you and the client, each for 1/3-part amounting to € 101,208.44.

You have wrongly deducted € 25,000.00 from the client's share for the benefit of the pension provision in Fridina Holding B.V. This concerns a private obligation of the B.V. to Ms [name 1] to pay her an annual sum of € 8,317.00 for her pension. It is in no way substantiated how this obligation leads to a reduction of the client's inheritance of € 25,000.00.

Moreover, it has not been shown that the B.V. would have insufficient capital to meet this obligation. After all, from your email of 13 July 2013 to the client, it appears that there is a securities portfolio in the Holding. The pension obligation must first be paid from this. Client has not received any information from you about this. You have only stated that you withhold € 25,000.00 from the client's inheritance from the sale of the apartment. Without proper substantiation, the client is entitled to her entire inheritance in this regard.

[…]

Auctions

An auction also took place concerning the contents, including antiques. This generated a revenue of € 3,151.75. You have wrongly deducted this full amount from the payment to the client as a result of the sale of the apartment. If you were already entitled to withhold an amount, you could only do so for the part to which you were entitled (ie 1/3 part, namely € 1,050.58). You have therefore deducted an amount of € 2,101.17 from the part of the sales proceeds for the benefit of the client.

In addition, a second auction has also taken place.

[…]

Whatever the case may be - the auction has already taken place and cannot be reversed - you have not divided the proceeds from this auction among the heirs. The client is therefore still entitled to its part (1/3 part) of the proceeds. It is unknown to the client how high the proceeds from this second auction are and would like to hear from you.

All in all, the client therefore has a claim of € 26,182.59 + € 2,200.56 (plus statutory interest) = € 28,283.76 plus the unknown proceeds from the second auction. Client requests you to transfer this amount to her within 2 weeks of receipt of this letter and to inform her of the proceeds of the second auction. '

2.14.
By letter of 6 June 2018 to the aforementioned letter, [defendant 1] responded as follows:

'The estate contains a life-long pension obligation on behalf of [name 1]. As you indicate yourself, this has been transferred to Fridina Holding B.V. The heirs have a debt to the Holding. This means that if there are no more financial resources, the heirs are called upon to fulfill the pension obligation. In order to prevent this situation from occurring, an amount was withheld in advance from the undivided estate.

[Claimant 1] has consulted and agreed to this. I refer you to the appendix for this. Incidentally, I myself paid € 25,000.00 for the pension obligation.

[…]

The first auction order was placed by [claimant 1]. In addition, on behalf of her, the auction proceeds from the first auction in the amount of € 3,151.75 were transferred to (afterwards) the bank number of [name 2]. E.e.a. has emerged from a statement by Mr [name 3] of the auction house. This amount should have been transferred to the heirs account and is therefore the reason that this amount has been settled with the credit of [Claimant 1]. Since not everything was sold at the first auction, another attempted sale was made. Mr [name 3] neatly transferred the proceeds of the full auction to the heirs 'account.'

2.15.
[Claimant 1] and [Defendant 1] have corresponded further. [Defendant 1] paid nothing more to [Claimant 1], which was reason for [Claimant 1] to start the present proceedings.

3 Scope of Dispute
3.1.
[Claimant 1] claims, after a change in claim, to be enforceable by order in case of stock:

I. Order [defendant 1] in his capacity as executor, as well as heir and former administrator of the estate of the deceased, to pay [claimant 1] an amount of € 41,217.50 plus statutory interest;

II. order [defendant 1] in his capacity as executor, as well as heir and former administrator of the estate of the deceased, to pay [defendant 2] an amount of € 16,217.50, plus statutory interest;

III. [defendant 1] in his capacity as executor, as well as ordering the heir and former administrator of the estate of the deceased to be sentenced within a reasonable time after the death of [name 1], but no later than 6 months after her death to settle the (remaining ) to leave a legacy, which will in any case imply - but not exclusively - the sale of the securities portfolio on the balance sheet of the private company Fridina Holding BV as well as the other assets; and - subsequently - to dissolve this private company and, after deduction of any costs, to pay the proceeds of the sale together with the balance of the heir account to [claimant 1], so that they each 1/3 part of the remaining inheritance ex article 3: 185 BW received;

IV. [defendant 1] in his capacity as executor and former administrator of the estate of the deceased, pursuant to Section 4: 161 of the Dutch Civil Code, to be accountable within 14 days of this judgment, for the period from death of the deceased to the present day , whereby the following information and evidence must also be provided to the other heirs, but not exclusively;

 an overview of the received (net) rent with supporting documents of the house at [the house] 189-7 in Groningen for the period 28 February 2012 to 1 February 2016;

 the annual accounts of Fridina Holding B.V. 2009 to 2016 and the year 2018;

 a statement of the securities portfolio for 2009 to 2018;

 documentary evidence of the amount paid in mid-2011/2012 under the testator's guarantee in the bankruptcy of Fridina Nijverdal B.V .;

 proof of payment of the claim against Koeltechnische Industrie Fridina B.V .;

 an overview of the costs deducted from the reservation on the heir account in the amount of € 45,000.00;

 the account statements of the heirloom from the date of death until the present;

 the pension agreement of the Holding showing the pension commitment to Ms [name 1].

V. and further determine that [defendant 1] forfeits an immediately payable penalty of € 1,000.00 for each day that he fails to comply with the conviction mentioned under III and IV;

VI. with [defendant 1] ordered to pay the costs.

3.2.
[Claimant 1] bases its claim, succinctly stated, on the following. [defendant 1], in his capacity as ex-author in 2012 and in 2016, made agreements with [claimant 1] and [defendant 2] regarding a partial distribution of the deceased's estate. [defendant 1] has not fully complied with the distribution agreements, so it is primarily claimed that he does so as yet and, alternatively, that the court partially distributes the estate as referred to in Section 3: 185 Dutch Civil Code, in the sense that [defendant 1] to [Claimant 1]. ] must pay an amount of € 41,217.50 and to [defendant 2] an amount of € 16,217.50. To this end, [Claimant 1] argues the following.

Part of the distribution agreements in 2012 included the fact that the current account debt to Fridina Holding B.V. in respect of the pension obligation of [name 1] and in the amount of € 94,122.00 would be repaid and that an amount of € 45,000.00 would be reserved on the heir account for any costs, provided that [defendant 1] a specified final statement would be made. [Defendant 1] has not provided a specification of the costs that he considers to be incurred, as a result of which the condition is not met. [Defendant 1] must therefore pay 1/3 of the amount of € 45,000.00 reserved on the heir account to [Claimant 1] and 1/3 of the amount reserved on the heir account to [Defendant 2].

In 2016 the house was sold. The sale proceeds of the house amounted to € 303,625.32. [Claimant 1], [Defendant 1] and [Defendant 2] were entitled to 1/3 of that amount, an amount of € 101,208.44. [Defendant 1] paid this amount to [Defendant 2]. [Claimant 1] only received an amount of € 73,056.69 from [Defendant 1] instead of an amount of € 101,208.44. [defendant 1] wrongly deducted from [claimant 1] an amount of € 25,000.00 from the amount of € 101,208.44 in connection with a claim by Fridina Holding B.V. with regard to the pension provision to [name 1]. In addition, [defendant 1] has deducted an amount of € 3,151.75. [Claimant 1] received this amount in respect of the sale of testator's antiques. Insofar as [Defendant 1] may deduct an amount related to the sale of the antiques, this is 2/3 of € 3,151.75, because [Claimant 1] can claim 1/3 of that amount. In addition, the proceeds from the second sale of the antiques, amounting to € 501.25, should also be distributed.

3.3.
In addition, it is requested that [defendant 1] within six months after the death of [name 1] proceed with the settlement of the (remaining) estate of testator. Finally, under Article 4: 161 of the Dutch Civil Code, [defendant 1] must account and account for the period in which he performed the task of resolution administrator. [Defendant 1] is moreover, as an executor, obliged under Article 4: 148 of the Dutch Civil Code to provide [Claimant 1] with all the information she requires. Accountability and accountability must be provided by [defendant 1] by submitting the documents referred to under IV, this on pain of forfeiture of a penalty.

3.4.
[Defendant 1] defends and concludes that [Claimant 1] is inadmissible in its claims, or at least rejects it, with - enforceable in stock - [Claimant 1] being ordered to pay the costs of these proceedings. To his defense [defendant 1], succinctly stated, makes the following statements. Article 4: 145 paragraph 1 of the Dutch Civil Code provides that if an executor has been appointed who has the task of managing the estate of the estate, the heirs do not dispose of those goods or their share thereof without his cooperation or authorization from the subdistrict court, before his authority to administer finished. [Claimant 1] and [Defendant 2] can therefore only dispose of estate or their share of it with the cooperation of [Defendant 1] or authorization of the Subdistrict Court. As long as [defendant 1] has not finished his task as an executor, there can be no question of division. Moreover, in 2012 and 2016, the parties did not make agreements about a partial distribution. This is also evident from the correspondence submitted. Contrary to what [Claimant 1] argues, the parties did not agree in 2012 that the current account debt of € 76,853.00 at that time would be repaid. Furthermore, [defendant 1] must account for the reserved amount of € 45,000.00 in due course, but that obligation did not yet apply when the parties agreed that this amount would be reserved for possible costs. In 2016, the amount of € 25,000.00 at [Claimant 1] was deducted from 1/3 of the sale proceeds from the home due to the payment of the current account debt of Fridina Holding B.V. This makes Fridina Holding B.V. enabled to continue to meet the obligations to pay pension to [name 1]. The amount of € 3,151.75 has been deducted from 1/3 of the sales proceeds from the sale of antiques, because that amount is due to the estate.

3.5.
Furthermore, there is no ground on the basis of which [Defendant 1] must be convicted to settle the (remaining) estate of [Defendant 1] within six months after the death of [Name 1]. Finally, [defendant 1] does not yet have to provide an account and account. According to the will, that obligation only exists when both his task as resolution administrator and his task as executor have ended and this is not yet the case. [defendant 1] is currently only obliged to provide information as an executor and this does not include the obligation to provide the documents desired by [claimant 1].

4 Reasons of the Decision

Competent court and applicable law 4.1.
Now that [claimant 1] is resident in Great Britain and the claim is of an international nature, the first question to be answered is whether the Dutch court has jurisdiction to hear the claims and if so, which law should be applied .

4.2.
The testator died after August 17, 2015, so the Inheritance Ordinance applies. Under Article 4 of the Inheritance Law, the courts of the Member State where the testator was habitually resident at the time of death have international jurisdiction to rule on the succession as a whole. It is not disputed that the deceased had his habitual residence in the Netherlands at the time of his death, so that the Dutch court has jurisdiction to decide on these claims. Dutch law also applies, because testator has made a valid choice for Dutch law in his will (Article 22 of the Inheritance Regulation).

Miter

4.3.
[Defendant 2] did not appear (in time) in the present proceedings, so that he was absent from office. Pursuant to Article 140 paragraph 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Rv), now that [defendant 1] has appeared, a single judgment is rendered between all parties that must be regarded as a judgment of contradiction.

Change of claim

4.4.
[Claimant 1], he has increased her claim by March 10, 2020. [Defendant 1] has no objection to the changed requirement. With regard to [defendant 2], he has not appeared in the proceedings and under Article 130 DCCP a change or increase in claim against him is excluded, unless [claimant 1] changes or multiplication in time to [defendant 2] ]. Although the latter has not happened, the court will admit the amended claim, because [Claimant 1] has only increased the claim under IV and that claim has not been brought against [Defendant 2]. After all, [Claimant 1] claims that [Defendant 1] provides certain documents to her. Furthermore, [Claimant 1] has reduced her claim during the hearing after the reply, in the sense that in the petition of the writ of summons € 41,775.89 and € 16,775.89 must be read € 41,217.50 and € 16,217.50 . This change of requirement is permissible under Article 129 DCCP.

The progress

4.5.
The present proceedings are essentially a distribution dispute. [Claimant 1] has brought several claims, which the court will assess point by point below.

Claims I and II

4.6.
[Claimant 1] explained in more detail after the reply that her claims under I and II primarily intended to claim compliance with the partial distribution agreements that [Defendant 1] in his capacity as executor (and therefore not in the capacity of resolution administrator) with [Claimant 1] and [Defendant 2], and in the alternative, insofar as the court finds that those agreements have not been made, that the court partially divides the estate. The most far-reaching defense that [defendant 1] puts forward against this is that the claim of [claimant 1] with regard to partial distribution is premature, because under article 4: 145 Civil Code distribution could only be considered as [defendant 1]. has completed his task as an executor. The court considers this as follows.

4.7.
It has been established between the parties that the task of [defendant 1] as executor has not yet ended. Article 4: 145 of the Dutch Civil Code stipulates that in the event of the appointment of an executor, who has the task of managing estate of the estate, the heirs cannot dispose of those goods or their share in them without his cooperation or authorization from the subdistrict court, before his management authority has ended. The basic principle of Section 4: 145 of the Dutch Civil Code is that the execution must be completed before the estate can be divided. Contrary to what [Claimant 1] argues, this also applies to partial distribution pursuant to Section 3: 179 of the Dutch Civil Code. All this is subject to an exception, as stipulated in Article 4: 145 paragraph 1 of the Dutch Civil Code, if the executor cooperates in the (partial) distribution or if an authorization has been granted by the subdistrict court. The rationale of Section 4: 145 (1) of the Dutch Civil Code is that the possession by the heirs of the assets of the estate means that these assets are no longer under the control of the executor, so that the executor can no longer liquidate them settlement of the debts of the estate.

4.8.
The court understands that [claimant 1] (primarily) means that [defendant 1] cooperated in the aforementioned sense by making partial distribution agreements in 2012 and 2016 and that he only has to implement the agreements made. The court further understands that [claimant 1] is claiming partial fulfillment with regard to the agreements made in 2012, namely insofar as these relate to the reserved amount on the estate account of € 45,000.00. [Claimant 1] states that she has agreed that the amount of € 45,000.00 would be reserved for any costs, provided that [Defendant 1] make a specification of the costs that would be paid by [Defendant 1] . Because [defendant 1] did not do that at the time, the court understands that the condition has not been fulfilled and the agreement regarding the reservation has not been concluded. For that reason, 1/3 of that amount should now be paid to [Claimant 1].

4.9.
With [defendant 1], the court is of the opinion that [claimant 1] has insufficiently substantiated that [defendant 1] already had to provide a specification of the costs to be incurred at the time of making an appointment regarding the reservation and therefore did not meet the according to her condition. In the letter of 6 June 2012, (the former lawyer of) [Claimant 1] wrote that the heirs understand that a reservation must be held for possible costs and that, before agreeing on costs incurred, they first want to be notified taking a specified final bill. From this, the court understands that [claimant 1], contrary to what is now advocated by her, wanted at most only to inspect the costs that [defendant 1] would pay in the amount of € 45,000.00. It has neither been asserted nor established that [defendant 1] can already meet that condition, but has not yet done so. Moreover, insofar as the aforementioned condition would have been agreed, it is not possible to see without further explanation, which has not been given, on the basis of which [defendant 1] currently has to pay € 15,000.00 to [claimant 1]. [Claimant 1] does not claim that it has agreed with [Defendant 1] that [Defendant 1] would cooperate in the partial distribution of the amount of € 45,000 if he did not meet the condition set by [Claimant 1]. .

4.10.
[Claimant 1] has also insufficiently substantiated that in 2016 agreements were made with [Defendant 1] about a partial distribution. [Claimant 1] has argued that the property was sold in 2016, the sale proceeds amounted to € 303,625.32 and that [Claimant 1], [Defendant 1] and [Defendant 2] are all entitled to 1 / 3rd that amount. According to [Claimant 1], they would all immediately receive 1/3 of the sales proceeds, which is contested by [Defendant 1]. [Claimant 1] has not substantiated that [defendant 1] has made agreements about this with [claimant 1] and [defendant 2], in the sense that he would cooperate with the fact that they would both receive an amount of € 101,208.44. Moreover, the email of February 8, 2016 shows that [defendant 1] did not cooperate; he was only willing to use part of the sales proceeds with a view to the pension obligation towards [name 1]. Although this concerns one at Fridina Holding B.V. pledge, but [defendant 1] rightly argues that the legacy includes a current account debt to this company and that the partial repayment has resulted in the liquidity required for the fulfillment of the pension obligation. The fact that the creditors of [defendant 2] managed to recover 1 / 3rd of the sales proceeds through seizure does not change the above. [Defendant 2] must, as the defendant 1] has argued without contradiction, still have to pay the amount of € 25,000.00 (back). [Claimant 1] has not further asserted that [Defendant 1] cooperated in the distribution of the sales proceeds of the antiques, so that it is not clear why [Defendant 1] is currently 1/3 of the sales proceeds of € 3,653.00 must be paid to [Claimant 1] and [Defendant 2].

4.11.
In the alternative, [claimant 1] intended to demand that the court proceed to partial distribution, in the sense that [defendant 1] must pay [claimant 1] an amount of € 41,217.50 and [defendant 2] an amount of € 16,217 , 50. Now that the executive has not yet come to an end, the court cannot in principle proceed to do so, in view of the provisions of Article 4: 145 paragraph 1 of the Dutch Civil Code. This may be different if [Claimant 1] provides sufficient facts and circumstances from which it can follow that the debts of the estate have been paid and she has a sufficient interest in her claim (in line with HR 19 May 2017, ECLI: NL: HR: 2017 : 939), but [Claimant 1] did not state that.

4.12.
The foregoing means that the claims under I and II with regard to (compliance with) the partial distribution (agreements) will be rejected.

Claim III

4.13.
[Claimant 1] has in no way substantiated the reason why [Defendant 1] should and can be convicted to settle the (remaining) estate within six months after the death of [Name 1]. In the opinion of the court, there is also no reason to assume that [Defendant 1] will not complete his task as an executor. This part of the claim will therefore be rejected.

Claim IV

4.14.
It has been established between the parties that the task of [defendant 1] as resolution administrator has now ended and that of [defendant 1] as executor has not yet ended. The parties disagree on whether [defendant 1] should now be accountable for the period in which he performed his duties as resolution administrator. According to [Claimant 1], this is the case because Article 4: 161 paragraph 1 of the Dutch Civil Code stipulates that at the end of his duties the administrator must be accountable and accountable to the entitled party, in this case the heirs. According to [defendant 1], this is not the case, because the will contains a specific regulation about the accountability and that regulation must be interpreted in such a way that the accountability must only take place if both the task of [defendant 1] as resolution administrator when the task of [defendant 1] as executor has ended. [Claimant 1] disputes - the court understands - that explanation.

4.15.
The court considers that the will must be interpreted in application of Article 4:46 BW. This means that the explanation must take into account the proportions that the will apparently wishes to regulate and the circumstances under which the will was made. The testator appointed [defendant 1] as executor and expanded the duties and powers of [defendant 1] by also appointing him as resolution administrator. [defendant 1] has been appointed a so-called 'three-star executor'. In this will, testator has included certain regulations in his will under the heading 'executor and resolution administrator'. Under that heading it is stipulated that 'the executor' is obliged to account to his heirs at the end of his management. The court is of the opinion that in view of the combined task of [defendant 1] as executor and resolution administrator and the fact that the settlement of accounts and accountability is included under the heading executor and resolution administrator, the will must be interpreted in such a way that [ defendant 1] must be accountable if his task as 'three-star executor' has ended. In the opinion of the court, this explanation is not inconsistent with Section 4: 161 BW. Since [defendant 1] 's task as executor has not yet ended, [defendant 1] does not yet have to give an account and account.

4.16.
The parties further disagree on whether [defendant 1] must submit the documents desired by [claimant 1] to her under Article 4: 148 of the Dutch Civil Code. Article 4: 148 of the Dutch Civil Code stipulates that the executor must give an heir all the information he requires about the performance of his duties. The rationale of this article means that the executor must provide the heirs with such information that they can gain insight into the way in which he manages it. The information is therefore limited to the data that is necessary for that purpose. [Claimant 1] has not substantiated why [Defendant 1] must specifically submit the documents claimed by her in order to fulfill his obligation to provide information to her. [Claimant 1] also based her claim in the first instance on the fact that [defendant 1] as an executor must be accountable and in that context submit the documents that she has claimed. It subsequently changed the basis of its claim, but did not substantiate that further. In addition, [Defendant 1] provided a large part of the documents requested by [Claimant 1] (Exhibits 1 to 11 of [Defendant 1]). This part of the claim will therefore be rejected.

4.17.
Finally, the court considers that the question whether [defendant 1] has been summoned in the right capacity can remain unanswered, because the claims will be dismissed.

4.18.
In view of the relationship between the parties, the legal costs between them will be compensated, in the sense that each party will bear its own costs.

5 Decision
The court

5.1.
rejects the claims;

5.2.
offsets the process costs, in the sense that each party bears its own costs.

This judgment was rendered by Mr. M. Sanna and was pronounced in public on April 22, 2020.
