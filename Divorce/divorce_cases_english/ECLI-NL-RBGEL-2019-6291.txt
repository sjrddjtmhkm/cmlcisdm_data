[claimant],

[residence],

claimant,

lawyer mr. Ph.J.N. Aarnoudse in Deventer,

against

[defendant],

[residence],

defendant,

lawyer mr. P-P.F. Tummers at [place].

Parties will hereinafter be referred to as [claimant] and [defendant].

1 Proceedings
1.1.
The course of the procedure can be seen from:

the summons with productions,

production 10 by summons, on the part of [claimant],

the email of 5 November 2019 with productions, from [defendant],

the oral hearing of November 8, 2019, of which the registrar has noted.

1.2.
Finally, judgment has been determined.

2 Facts
2.1.
[claimant] and Mr [Name 1] are the owners of a house located at the [street name] [number] in [place] (hereinafter: the house). They have been married. The marriage was dissolved on November 23, 2017. In the decision of the Amsterdam District Court of 25 October 2017, the divorce was pronounced and it was determined that an attached covenant is part of that decision. To the extent relevant, the covenant states: (…)

Article 5 Allocation of home and mortgage

The house and the entire mortgage debt are allocated to the man, under his obligation to ensure that the woman is released from the joint and several liability for the mortgage debt, and to indemnify the woman in this respect. The man declares in advance that the mortgage provider agrees to release the woman from joint and several liability. At the request of the husband, the woman will take the necessary actions to put both the mortgage and the home in the husband's name.

(…)

2.2.
[claimant] has left the former matrimonial home. [Name 1] is there

(initially) continue to live. [Defendant] has withdrawn from [Name 1]. They have signed a deed, dated August 1, 2018, entitled “Housing lease” (hereinafter: the lease). This rental agreement states the following with regard to the parties and the address of [Name 1]:

(…)

The undersigned

[claimant] [Name 1], born in [date of birth], residing in ([postcode]) [place] at the [street name] [number], hereinafter referred to as "landlord",

And (…) [defendant], (..), hereinafter referred to as tenant (…).

Pursuant to this agreement, [defendant] rents from [Name 1] the house at the [street name] [number] in [place] for an initial rent of € 700 per month. The lease has been entered into for the duration of 24 months.

2.3.
[Name 1] has not implemented the covenant in the sense that the former matrimonial home has not been registered and [plaintiff] has so far not been exempt from the mortgage loan.

By order of August 22, 2019, the court authorized Gelderland [claimant] at its request to sell the house. [claimant] approached a broker to be able to proceed with the sale. The broker visited the house on November 6, 2019. [defendant] did not let him in.

2.4.
[Name 1] stopped paying the monthly mortgage payments about seven months ago.

3 Scope of Dispute
3.1.
[Plaintiff] claims that the preliminary relief judge of the Gelderland District Court condemns [defendant] by judgment to be declared enforceable for stock:

a. to leave and vacate the house in ([postcode]) [place], at the [street name] [number] within 48 hours after service of the judgment with his and his own and with the keys released for free to put at the disposal of [claimant];

b. in the event of non-compliance with the provisions under a, to stipulate that [defendant] forfeits a penalty payment of € 500.00 per day, at least an amount to be determined by you in good justice;

c. to authorize [claimant], if [defendant] fails to evacuate, to have this done by a bailiff at the expense of [defendant], if necessary with the help of the strong arm;

d. to pay the legal costs.

3.2.
[plaintiff] states - in short - that [defendant] is staying in the house without a right or title. Therefore, she claims to order [defendant] to be evicted. She has an urgent interest in that claim because she wants to use the obtained authorization to sell the house. Now that [Name 1] has not been paying the mortgage payments for several months, the mortgage debt is rising. [Claimant] states that the mortgage lender has already approached her for payment of the arrears and, if payment is not (much) longer, will proceed to foreclosure sale, with the risk that a residual debt will continue to exist and [Claimant] for that, now [Name 1] has no income and does have debts, (also) will be used.

[Claimant] disputes that there is a (valid) lease between [Name 1] and [defendant]. As the co-owner, [claimant] has not given permission for that rental. Moreover, rent is out of the question because the elements of a lease have not been complied with, since [Name 1] also lived in the house at the start of the rent and afterwards with [defendant]. There is therefore no question of "provision" required for rent. [defendant] and [Name 1] started living together as partners. Furthermore, it has not been established that the alleged rental payments are transferred to an account in the name of [Name 1].

If the agreement does qualify as rent, this is a sham construction, apparently to prevent that [claimant] can sell the house and / or [defendant] the house can be evicted.

Now that the home is less profitable in the rented state than in the uninhabited state, [claimant] has the right and interest in assigning its claim.

3.3.
The defendant filed a defense and concluded that the claims should be declared inadmissible or at least dismissed. [Defendant] disputes that [Claimant] has an urgent interest in the claim and, according to the preliminary relief judge, asserts her claims that the case is too complicated for a provisional injunction. [defendant] disputes that she is staying in the house without a right or title. To this end, it relies on the lease concluded with [Name 1]. This is legally valid. She also pays rent from July 2018. She was also allowed to assume that [Name 1] was authorized to rent out. There is no sham agreement. Meanwhile, [Name 1] has left the house after [the defendant] and he had an argument about six months ago. [defendant] is registered as a house seeker and has applied for an urgent declaration. Furthermore, [defendant] notes that the sale of the home in the rented state will in any case be more than the remaining mortgage debt.

4 Reasons of the Decision
4.1.
In these proceedings, an assessment must be made as to whether the evacuation claim, or a claim of similar effect, has the likelihood of success in any main proceedings that justification is justified. In view of the provisional nature of the summary proceedings, no extensive investigation into the facts is appropriate and there is no room for further evidence. There is no reason to deviate from this rule in this case. The preliminary relief judge therefore bases the decision on facts that have been acknowledged, have not been contradicted or that have become plausible for the time being.

4.2.
[plaintiff] has an urgent interest in the claim as, despite the agreements made in the covenant, she has still not been released from the mortgage loan, she has obtained permission from the court to sell the house, [Name 1] the monthly mortgage payments has not paid for a large number of months and it has been made sufficiently plausible that the house will yield more in uninhabited than in occupied state.

4.3.
The fact that [name 1] was not authorized to rent out the house in the relationship with [claimant] cannot be objected to [defendant]. The claim by [claimant] on the lack of jurisdiction of [Name 1] is therefore dismissed.

4.4.
It has become sufficiently plausible that the written (rental) agreement concluded by [defendant] and [Name 1] does not qualify as a lease or must be regarded as a sham construction. The fact that a written agreement, referred to as a lease, has been concluded and that, for the time being, it must be assumed that [defendant] has made (rental) payments to [Name 1], which, moreover, is disputed by [claimant] does not different. [Defendant] actually withdrew from [Name 1] when they had an affective relationship. As the home address of [Name 1], as the landlord, the rental agreement contains the address of the house, the leased property. Neither the house nor part of it has been made available to [defendant]. This does not meet one of the required elements for the conclusion of a lease (Article 6: 201 BW). Although, in view of the Supreme Court's case law, there can be question of shared tenancy, this is not the case in this case. This concerns cohabitation with the owner with whom the tenant had an affective relationship, at least when the lease was concluded and for a long time afterwards. There is therefore no question of a rental agreement as referred to in Section 7: 201 BW. The fact that, as stated by [defendant] at the hearing, [Name 1] has not lived in the house for several months, which has been confirmed by [Name 1] at the hearing, does not change that.

4.5.
For the sake of completeness, it is considered that, insofar as there is a rental agreement, this must be interpreted as a sham construction in view of the affective relationship that existed at the time of the conclusion of the lease and in any case long afterwards. There was, now that [defendant] actually moved in with [Name 1], no reason for entering into a lease, in any case a valid reason has not been stated or proved.

In view of what has been considered above, [defendant] cannot derive any right to stay in the house from the written rental agreement. It has therefore become sufficiently plausible that [defendant] is staying in the house without a right or title.

Therefore, the claim to order [defendant] to evict the home, as reported below, will be upheld. Now that [defendant] is staying there with her children, in view of these circumstances she will be granted a little more than the usual term of eviction. This period will be set at 30 days after the present judgment has been served. The claim of [claimant] to grant permission to evacuate the house himself if [defendant] fails to do so will be upheld. The claim in respect of a penalty payment will be dismissed, now that [claimant] will be able to effect the eviction himself if necessary.

4.6.
The co-demanded authorization to the claimant to have the evacuation carried out if necessary, with the invocation of the strong arm, is rejected. Under the law, the claimant is not allowed to handle the evacuation himself and the forced eviction is reserved to the bailiff. The plaintiff does not need authorization to enlist the help of the bailiff. Partly in view of Articles 557 and 444 DCCP, the bailiff himself does not need judicial authorization to enlist the help of the strong arm.

4.7.
The defendant will be ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings as the largely unsuccessful party. The costs on the side of [claimant] are estimated at:

- court registry fee 81.00

- authorized representative's salary 980.00

Total € 1,061.00

In the absence of a legal basis, a cost order with the obligation to pay the operating costs to the registrar is not possible.

4.8.
The judgment will be declared enforceable at stock as requested.

The preliminary relief judge

5.1.
condemns [defendant] to vacate the house at the [street name] [number] ([postcode]) in [place] within 30 days of the notification of this judgment, with all persons present with it and matters to which it belongs, and the handing over keys to [claimant],

5.2.
authorizes [claimant] to evacuate the [street name] [number] ([zip code]) in [place] if [defendant] does not comply with the conviction under paragraph 5.1,

5.4.
declares this sentence enforceable to the extent that it is available in stock,

the more or otherwise advanced is rejected.
