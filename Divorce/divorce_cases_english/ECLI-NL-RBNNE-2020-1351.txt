Pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Participation Act, the municipality requests the court to pay the amount owed by the husband for the benefit of his minor children [minor 1] and [minor 2], with effect from 1 December 2017 and for as long as the assistance to [the wife] continues to be determined as feasible as possible in stock at € 188.00 per month or an amount that the court deems correct in good justice and to determine the overdue maintenance contribution for the period from 1 December 2017 to 30 September 2019 at an amount of € 4,324.00 and to determine that this amount is immediately due and payable.

3.2.
The municipality bases its requests on the basis that the man has sufficient capacity to contribute to the costs of the children with an amount of € 188.00 per month, now that the municipality does not take into account the determination of the capacity of the man. keeps paying off debts, which he pays monthly.


4.1.
The man defends and concludes that the requests of the municipality are rejected.

4.2.
In summary, the man bases his defense on the following.

The man pays monthly an amount of € 215.00 in interest / repayment of a revolving credit, large € 24,000.00, which stems from his marriage to [the woman]. In addition, he pays an amount of € 495.00 per month to the tax authorities in connection with tax debts that also arise from the marriage period. Since this concerns non-culpable and unavoidable burdens, as referred to in section 7.2.1 of the Alimony Standards report (hereinafter: "Treme report"), these must be deducted from the man's ability to pay. In the alternative, the man invokes the acceptability test of paragraph 7.3 of the report. In addition, the man claims that his financial conditions have deteriorated

4 Reasons of the Decision

5.1.
In the present case, the parties are divided on the answer to the question whether the repayment of debts that the debtor has to pay should be taken into account in determining the debtor's ability to pay. There is no dispute between the parties that debts arose during the marriage of the husband and [the wife] and that the husband had a monthly amount of € 215.00 (to the revolving credit) and

Repay € 495 (to the Tax Authorities). According to the man, these repayments lower his ability to pay, while the municipality believes that due to the primacy of child maintenance, the repayments are not taken into account and, moreover, since the new child maintenance guidelines that came into effect on 1 April 2013, only with necessary burdens, which can be considered reasonable expenses towards the children. The municipality is of the opinion that the judgment of the Supreme Court of 11 July 2008 (NJ 2008,402) no longer applies because the child maintenance guidelines came into effect afterwards.

5.2.
The court considers that since 1 April 2013 the calculation of the financial capacity available for child maintenance is indeed based on a fixed calculation model, which also follows from the Treme report. In section 7.2, the Treme report explicitly provides the option of taking into account repayments on non-culpable and unavoidable debts when calculating the capacity-less income.

5.3.
There is no dispute between the parties that the man repays the debts that have arisen in the marriage period with the amounts he has set. According to settled case law of the Supreme Court, in determining the capacity of the debtor, in principle, all debts of the debtor must be taken into account. In the present case, it is established that the man repays on marital debts. According to section 7.2.1 of the Treme Report, additional charges, such as debts, can be taken into account by increasing the payless income with the repayment of those debts and thus deviating from the standard calculation model. The condition is that the debts are not culpable and cannot be avoided. As this concerns the repayment of marital debts, which would have depressed the family budget if the marriage had continued and if the municipality has not, or has not sufficiently motivated, disputed that the debts are not culpable and cannot be avoided, the court will determine the man's ability to take into account the repayments on marital debts. Paragraph 7.2 of the Treme report does not require that the burdens must be necessary and that they can be considered reasonable expenses towards the children, as stated by the municipality.

5.4.
There is no dispute between the parties that there is no capacity left with the man if the repayments are taken into account. This leads to the conclusion that the man has no means to contribute to the costs of the children, so the requests of the municipality will be rejected. Now that the man's primary defense is successful, the court is unable to assess the substantive defense of the man's substantive defense.
