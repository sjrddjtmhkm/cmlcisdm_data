2 Facts

The father was married to [X].

[Defendant] was born from this marriage. [Defendant] 's younger sister [A] was also born from this marriage.

By decision of December 5, 2012, this court pronounced the divorce between the father and [X]. This decision was entered in the registers of civil status on 16 January 2013.

By order of this court of 5 February 2014, the contribution to be paid by the father in the costs of care and upbringing of [respondent] was set at € 446.50 per month.

Pursuant to the statutory indexation, this contribution amounts to € 493.97 per month from 1 January 2020.

3 Appeal

The father requests the court by order, as far as practicable in stock, to change the contribution of care and education (now the cost of living and study) of [defendant] established by order of this court of February 5, 2014. and to set this contribution further at nil, or at such an amount as the court deems appropriate, with effect from the date of submission of the application, or from a date to be determined by the court.

The father states - briefly and succinctly - the following.

After the divorce, there was hardly any care and contact arrangement between the father and [defendant]. [defendant] has been diagnosed with Asperger's. As a result, [defendant] benefits from, among other things, structure, keeping appointments, taking his medication and following training. The father did everything to guide [defendant] on his way to adulthood. From the age of majority, the father pays the contribution (indexed to € 503.51 per month in 2019, according to his statement) directly to [respondent]. [defendant] went to live on his own, while the father would like to see him live with an escort. [Defendant] has since made a mess of his life. His situation has deteriorated and he is slipping further and further. [defendant] gambles, he drinks an excessive amount of alcohol, he uses drugs, he is in debt and he often misses school. He was criminally convicted for this absenteeism. The Subdistrict Court imposed a suspended sentence on [defendant]. However, [defendant] has not complied with the conditions set.

The father has made agreements with [defendant] about getting his life back on track, but [defendant] has not fulfilled those agreements. [defendant] does not accept that his father calls him to account for his behavior. [defendant] communicates rudely via WhatsApp with his father. [Respondent] also informed his father by e-mail that he officially distances himself from his father. [defendant] has made a request to have his family name changed to that of his mother. This request has been granted.

[Respondent] is therefore guilty of misconduct towards his father within the meaning of Article 1: 399 of the Dutch Civil Code (BW). The father therefore requests that the maintenance be set to zero, or that the maintenance be reduced. Due to the behavior of [defendant], the father did not pay the maintenance for a number of months, but did reserve it for [defendant]. [Respondent] then called in the National Bureau for the Collection of Maintenance Contributions (LBIO). The father immediately paid the maintenance to [defendant] again, including the overdue maintenance.

During the oral hearing, the father read an extensive letter to [defendant], in which he asked a number of questions to [defendant]. He also outlined the role he played as a father in [defendant's] life. The father emphatically suggests that he has always been available to [respondent], even at the difficult moments in [respondent's] life. The rejection by [defendant] is extremely painful and sad for the father.

 The defense
[defendant] requests the court to reject the father's request to moderate his maintenance obligation. He requests the court to understand that he does not have to account to his father for the use of the contribution to be received in the cost of living and study.

[Respondent] argues the following for this. He has Asperger's syndrome, which means that his load-bearing capacity is very low. The contact between him and his father has always been very problematic. By order of the juvenile court judge of 26 January 2012, [respondent] was placed under supervision and an authorization was issued for out-of-home care in a crisis foster family.

There has been a very extensive fighting divorce between the parents of [respondent]. The relationship between [defendant] and his father has been severely damaged. This relationship has never fully recovered, partly due to the father's move to [province]. The father also does not have a good relationship with [A], the sister of [defendant].

The father tries to paint a wrong picture of [defendant]. He also tries in every possible way to exercise power over [defendant]. The maintenance is structurally paid too late. [Respondent] indeed called in the LBIO when his father no longer paid the maintenance. His father wishes that [respondent] regularly accounts and accounts for his income and expenditure. [respondent] has come of age [2018] and has since then usurped many freedoms over a six-month period. He wanted to enjoy life and discover many things. [defendant] acknowledges much of the accusations made by his father. The absenteeism due to school is partly due to its low load capacity. From April 2019 things are going better with [respondent]. [defendant] did not yet realize that he needs help. He now realizes that there are serious problems. [respondent] is registered with the Yes We Can Clinics program. This is a recognized specialist mental healthcare institution. He will reside there internally from December 4, 2019 to February 12, 2020. The Subdistrict Court has held the further hearing of the compulsory education case until March 4, 2020 to await the results of this process. [defendant] has registered for the VWO state examination. He plans to graduate in the spring of 2020. [defendant] has himself applied for an entry ban for Holland Casino. This prohibition has been in force since February 13, 2019 and has now been extended at the request of [respondent].

[defendant] is of the opinion that there is no misconduct against his father. What he said and did during his minor age cannot be objected to him in the context of the aforementioned Article 1: 399 of the Dutch Civil Code. The behavior alleged by his father during the age of majority of [defendant] took place in a relatively short period. [defendant] is free to choose not to have contact with his father and to change his family name. These circumstances do not justify a moderation of the maintenance contribution to be paid by the father to [defendant].

During the oral hearing, [defendant] explained that he unfortunately had to end the program at Yes We Can prematurely, because he was unable to deal properly with the many incentives that he had to deal with. [defendant] is now preparing for the VWO state examination which he intends to take in a few months' time. [defendant] now lives with his mother again. After the state examination, [respondent] wants to orientate himself on further education. Currently, [respondent] has a structured weekly schedule, in which he also works partly and generates income. He must also pay part of this as board money to his mother.

According to [defendant], his father and he have a different truth about how things have gone between them. The way in which the father wanted to fill in the contact and his involvement is not the way in which [respondent] wanted to do this. [Respondent] was unable to explain to the father what he would like. This has hurt [respondent] very much and in the end this was the reason to break contact from a form of self-protection.

4 Reasons of the Decision

Parents have a legal maintenance obligation to their children. This maintenance obligation is not based on solidarity, such as between ex-spouses, but on kinship.

The law provides for the possibility of applying a moderation (Article 1: 399 of the Dutch Civil Code) on the basis of such conduct by the maintenance creditor that the provision of maintenance cannot reasonably or not be required in full from the debtor. This power of moderation does not apply to the maintenance obligation towards minor children, but does apply to adult children. From parliamentary history, as well as from case law, it appears that the maintenance obligation towards adult children expires only in very exceptional cases. In any case, a single grievous treatment of the maintenance creditor is insufficient for this. The lack of contact and the change of the genus name are not in themselves a reason to come to a zeroing or moderation. The relationship underlying the maintenance obligation means that this maintenance obligation weighs heavily. The power of moderation granted to the judge gives the judge a great deal of discretion, whereby a balance of interests must be made.

The question that has to be answered is whether there is such offensive behavior by [defendant] towards his father that payment of a maintenance contribution cannot reasonably be demanded, or not fully, from the father. In the opinion of the court, this is not the case in this case. In doing so, the court took the following into account.

The relationship between [defendant] and his father has been seriously disrupted over the years. The court has been able to take cognizance of the difficult and turbulent divorce proceedings conducted between [the defendant's] parents, which included a period of removal from the home of [the defendant], a move of the father to [province ] and a criminal report against the father. This period has left traces with both [defendant] and the father and in any case it has not helped their mutual understanding.

It is established that [respondent] was diagnosed with Asperger. This means that [respondent] among other things, more than other children, needs a certain structure and limitation of stimuli. As [defendant] mentioned: "It works differently for me in the upper room." From an early age this has required extra care and involvement from the parents.

It has been found that [defendant] has been difficult to handle in the period around the age of majority. During that period, both parents worked together and each individually to ensure the safety of [respondent], but also of the mother and [A], and to look for a place where [respondent] could thrive. In various areas of life such as housing, education, health, finances, there was instability or derailment. [defendant] hardly accepted the authority of his parents, if at all, and went his own way, gambling a lot and making debts in a short time. [Respondent] also spoke in word and deed against his father. [defendant] acknowledges that during that period he made statements to his father that he would have experienced as offensive. In the opinion of the court, the events during this period should also be considered against the process of "coming of age" in combination with the diagnosis Asperger. Although this period has been very difficult and difficult for both parents, the court does not consider the events to lead to an end or a reduction in the maintenance obligation.

It now seems that this "dissolute" period has come to an end and that [defendant], despite the difficulties he experiences because of his Asperger's, is making efforts to complete his training and to work on a meaningful route towards his future. At the moment there is no room for a relationship with his father, because of the disappointment that [defendant] has experienced repeatedly.

The court has obtained an image of a father, who is deeply involved in the well-being of [defendant] and would like to give substance to his fatherhood, by supporting [defendant] and providing advice and assistance. As stated by the father: "My door and my heart are always open to [defendant]."

The court sees an intelligent young man trying to give form and substance to his life through trial and error, and an injured father who feels disqualified from his parent role. The parties may succeed in finding and acknowledging each other over time.

[defendant] has requested the court to understand that he does not have to account to his father for how the contribution received has been spent. In the opinion of the court, there can be no such obligation. On the other hand, [respondent] can be expected to keep his father regularly informed (for example once every three months) about the progress in his training program.
