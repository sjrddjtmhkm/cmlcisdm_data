Parties were married from September 9, 2009 to May 10, 2012.

Before this marriage was born:

- [minor 1] (hereinafter: [minor 1]), in [place of birth] on [date of birth] 2009.

The parties jointly have parental authority over [minor 1].

[minor 1] has his primary residence with the mother.

3.2.
For the sake of completeness, the court notes that the mother has another son from another (now terminated) relationship: the 7-year-old [minor 2]. [minor 2] has access arrangements with his father, the same arrangement applies to [minor 1]. Both brothers together go to the father of [minor 2] for a weekend every fortnight.

The father has had a daughter from his current relationship: the 4-year-old [minor 3].

3.3.
Parties have established a parental plan at the time of their divorce. In summary, and in so far as relevant, they have agreed that [minor 1] will be with the father on even weekends every weekend, and that there will be additional contact on the father's morning or night shifts on one or two afternoons, and further that the summer holidays are divided by halves, with a maximum continuous journey of two weeks and the other holidays can be determined by mutual agreement, with a specific regulation regarding the holidays, the birthday of [minor 1] and birthdays of family members.

3.4.
The court understands from the content of the documents that the father and [minor 1] last saw each other in mid-2018.

3 Appeal

3.5.1.
On 18 November 2016, the mother requested the court to change the care scheme and to establish a guided contact arrangement between the father and [minor 1] of one hour once a week, based on the availability of Intervence and / or [institution] and determine that the authority over [minor 1] belongs exclusively to her.

3.5.2.
By interim order of March 21, 2017, the court arrested the case pending the care pathways in which the parties participated: system therapy and parentage mediation.

3.5.3.
Subsequently, by letter of March 15, 2019, the mother amended her request and primarily requested the court to determine that there will be no interaction at all between the father and [minor 1]. In the alternative, it has asked for a visitation arrangement between the father and [minor 1] to be established once a month on Sunday afternoon from 1 pm to 4.30 pm in a neutral place and without the children of the father's current partner, with the exception of the half-sister from [minor 1].

3.5.4.
In the contested decision, declared enforceable, the court rejected the mother's request for a change of authority.

Regarding the division of the care and upbringing duties, the court amended the divorce decision of January 11, 2012 and the parenting plan attached to it and provided that:

- the father and [minor 1] are entitled to have contact with each other once a month on a Sunday afternoon from 1 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. in a neutral place and without the children being present, in the context of the division of the care and upbringing duties. / relatives of the husband's current partner, except for the half-sister of [minor 1].

3.6.1.
The mother cannot agree with these decisions and she has appealed against them. In summary, she puts forward the following in brief.

4 Reasons of the Decision
Parental authority

The lack of (positive) cooperation and communication between parties is entirely due to the attitude of the father. The father has moved to an unknown address and is unreachable for the mother. The mother has to make a choice for high school next year. There is no communication with the father, or he is not aware of how [minor 1] is doing. The father will still play a role in the choice of school for [minor 1]. The mother is also dependent on the consent of the father during holidays or any medical treatment. The one-headed authority can act as a protective factor for [minor 1]. The father structurally declines when it comes to his parental responsibilities and shows no insight into what the ambiguities surrounding the contact mean for [minor 1]. The father has not shown any problem insight.

Care plan

The last physical contact that took place between [minor 1] and the father dates from May 2018. At the mother's insistence, a telephone contact took place on the birthday of [minor 1] in [month] 2019. The mother took the initiative, which has always been the case. The father shows no interest or initiative. On the other holidays or birthdays, [minor 1] has not received a gift, ticket or phone call from the father. During the meeting on March 29, 2019, the father indicated that he did not want an established care scheme. That proved too burdensome for his current family. The court considered it very important that the agreements about the care scheme were observed. It turned out that an appointment was never fulfilled by the father. After the hearing, there was no contact between the father and [minor 1].

3.6.2.
During the oral appeal, the mother added that [minor 1] had his birthday last week and that he heard nothing from his father. [minor 1] was hoping for a ticket or phone call. A day later, the father suddenly appeared at school against the agreements. The teachers were overwhelmed; they had never seen the father before. The father and [minor 1] then crossed closely. The father does not realize what it would mean for [minor 1] if he suddenly saw his father again after a year and a half. Moreover, [minor 1] would have preferred the father to have said something on his birthday instead of suddenly appearing at school. The mother finds it typical that the father did not appear to attend the oral hearing on appeal; he doesn't even bother to fight for the last bit of contact. [minor 1] was always very disappointed when the father did not show up for contact moments. He was upset for weeks. The mother only received the contact details from the father in June 2019; she now knows where he lives. The father called her twice that month, but after that she heard nothing from him. The mother sees in the person of the father too great an obstacle to come to contact arrangements. The mother remains open to contact between the father and [minor 1]. If the father approaches her directly to make appointments, she is always ready to have a conversation. She would prefer to see that the father plays an active role in the life of [minor 1].

3.7.1.
In summary, the father puts forward the following in his defense.

After the contested decision, the father contacted the GI several times to support him more and to help him regain his role as an involved father. In August 2019, the father was able to pick up the thread again with the new family manager. The father and mother have been invited for an interview by the family manager. Those discussions took place separately in mid-August. In the meantime, the father has had app contact with the mother about [minor 1]. The father even specially bought a phone for this and passed on his contact details to the mother. That was on May 17, 2019.

The father contacted the school of [minor 1] and requested information there.

The father endorses the position of the council and the court that it is important for [minor 1] if he remains involved as a father. He is willing to fulfill that role and expects the mother to offer him the space to do so. The father has asked the GI to take concrete measures on this point and work is underway.

3.7.2.
In the V form of February 17, 2020, the father reports that he is not coming to the hearing, because he feels that there is no place for him in the care plan for the mother and that he is therefore outside the door by the GI and other care providers. is being held. The father wants to keep parental authority over [minor 1]. He is in contact with the school of [minor 1]. It is not possible to conduct a visit without support. According to the father, the appeal appeal can be granted on that point.

3.8.
In short, the council stated during the appeal hearing that [minor 1] needs structural contact with his father. This is not feasible for the father. A permanent contact arrangement is therefore not realistic. Such an arrangement would result in continuous disappointment. The father cannot provide [minor 1] what he needs. The father and [minor 1] have a bond with each other and that bond must continue to exist. By ending the authority of the father and not establishing contact arrangements, [minor 1] gets the wrong signal. The council is more in favor of an arrest to see whether the father will still take his responsibility. The council is thinking of a few visits of [underage 1] to the father's home, guided by the care worker. The father tries to stay involved in his own way. It is impotence that he cannot do this.

3.9.
During the oral appeal, the GI stated that it had no objection to a change of authority, as requested by the mother. Due to the actions of the father for many years, the GI no longer trusts in contact arrangements, because the GI has given up hope that the father will still change.

The court considers the following.

Parental authority

3.10.1.
The court finds that after the marriage ended, the mother and father continued to exercise authority over [minor 1].

3.10.2.
Pursuant to Section 1: 253n of the Dutch Civil Code (BW), the judge may, at the request of the unmarried parents or one of them, end joint custody if the circumstances have subsequently changed or when the decision is made with incorrect or incomplete information. has gone out. Article 1: 253n BW paragraph 2 provides that Article 1: 251a BW paragraph 1 applies mutatis mutandis. This means that the judge can determine that the authority belongs to one parent if:

there is an unacceptable risk of the child becoming trapped or lost between the parents and it is not to be expected that sufficient improvement will occur in the foreseeable future, or

change of authority is otherwise necessary in the best interests of the child.

3.10.3.
The court states first of all that joint custody requires that the parents are able to exercise proper joint custody and that they can take joint decisions of any importance about their child, or at least be able to make agreements about situations that arise around the child. The lack of good communication between the parents does not automatically imply that in the interest of the child, the authority must be assigned to one of the parents.

3.10.4.
There has long been no question of a proper exercise of joint authority. The father has been inaccessible to the mother for a long time and she has only recently obtained a telephone number from him. The mother was therefore forced to make the necessary authority decisions with regard to [minor 1] alone: ​​consultation with the father was not even possible. The father has not shown direct involvement and / or interest in [minor 1] for quite some time. Moreover, now that there has been no contact (anymore) between him and [minor 1] for a year and a half, joint authority has in fact become impracticable. Although the mother is open to this, the father does not seek contact with her or with [minor 1]. In these circumstances, the court finds the father no longer able to take decisions regarding [minor 1] that are sufficiently in line with his current development (phase). Although the court appealed to the father about his passive attitude in the contested decision, the father is unable to change this. Ten months have passed since the contested decision was taken and a positive trend is barely noticeable. However, the father recently visited the school of [minor 1]. It has not become clear to the court what the father's intention was in this. The court would have liked to ask the father during the oral hearing. Whatever the case, the court sees in the one-off entry to school insufficient leads to judge that the father can still bear full responsibility that fits the role as an authoritative parent. The father gives little or no meaning to parenting. For the development of [minor 1] it is essential that the mother - as the only caring parent of [minor 1] - is enabled to independently make decisions regarding his care and upbringing, as she has in fact already been years alone. In view of these facts and circumstances, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that, in the interest of [minor 1], it is necessary to determine that from now on the authority belongs only to the mother.

3.10.5.
To this extent, the court will annul the contested decision and grant the mother's request to exercise sole authority over [minor 1] from now on.

Contact arrangements

3.11.1.
At the request of the parents or of one of them, the judge shall determine, whether or not for a definite period, regulations concerning the exercise of rights of access or deny the right of access, whether or not for a definite period. Pursuant to 1: 377a paragraph 3 of the Dutch Civil Code, the judge denies the right of access only if:

intercourse would seriously harm the child's mental or physical development, or;

the parent should be deemed manifestly unsuitable or manifestly incapable of association, or;

the child who is twelve years of age or older has expressed serious objections to his / her interaction with his parent, or;

handling is otherwise contrary to the compelling interests of the child.

3.11.2.
The 11-year-old [minor 1] is a vulnerable boy with child-related problems. He functions socially-emotionally at the level of a three to four-year-old. He is very concerned, has a low self-esteem and is very insecure. [minor 1] misses his father and would like to see him. The last contact between the father and [minor 1] has now taken place eighteen months ago. This is very unfortunate, especially because the court sees that the father and [minor 1] have a warm relationship with each other, which shows love and involvement. In recent years, a pattern has become visible in which the father increasingly withdraws from the life of [minor 1]. [minor 1] has repeatedly been disappointed when a planned contact with his father was canceled. In view of the problems that [minor 1] is struggling with, the court finds the mother's statement that [minor 1] is even upset for a few weeks after such a disappointment. It would be best for the development of [minor 1] if he has regular contact with his father and always knows when he will see his father again. Unfortunately, the father cannot live up to this. Under these circumstances, imposing access arrangements would be of little effect. It would only lead to [minor 1] looking forward to a contact that is likely to end in a new disappointment. In that case it is better that [minor 1] gets clarity and that, however unfortunate, it is not determined now that and when he will see his father. The Court of Appeal therefore considers that establishing a visitation arrangement is contrary to the compelling interests of [minor 1]. This request by the mother on appeal is also granted.

3.11.3.
The court informs the father that during the oral hearing the mother expressed her willingness to cooperate in mutual consultation on contact moments between the father and [minor 1]. When the father contacts her, she will always talk to him. The court is confident that the mother sincerely means this. The court sees an involved mother who has done her best in recent years to get the contacts between the father and [minor 1] off the ground. As far as the court and the mother are concerned, intervention of the care is not necessary. If the father took this step, the court would applaud it. The father could not do [minor 1] any greater pleasure by showing his face regularly.

3.11.4.
The court will also annul the contested decision with regard to the care scheme and amend the divorce order in the sense that no contact arrangements are established between the father and [minor 1].

3.12.
The court will compensate the legal costs, in view of the family law nature of the case.
