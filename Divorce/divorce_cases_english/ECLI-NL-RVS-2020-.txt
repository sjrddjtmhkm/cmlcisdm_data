By decision of April 18, 2018, the Minister rejected the repeated applications of [appellant] of March 28, 2018 for the granting of a Dutch passport for her underage daughters [daughter 1] and [daughter 2] (hereinafter: the children).

By decision of 29 June 2018, the Minister declared the objection lodged by [appellant] unfounded.

By judgment of 22 May 2019, the court declared the appeal lodged by [appellant] unfounded. This statement is attached.

[Appellant] appealed against this judgment.

The minister has made a written statement.

The Division heard the case at its hearing on February 26, 2020, where the Minister, represented by I.S. IJserinkhuijsen, has appeared.

Considerations

2 Reasons of the Decision

1. The legal assessment framework is set out in the Annex, which forms part of this judgment.

preface

2. [appellant] lives with the children in Peru. She has Dutch nationality. The children were born in the United States on [2011], but are of Dutch nationality. Their father, [father's name], also has Dutch nationality.

    On 30 June 2014, while she was still living in Qatar, [appellant] turned to the minister with applications for Dutch passports for the children. As a result, the minister requested [appellant] to provide a statement of consent from the other parent or a replacement statement of consent from a competent court within four weeks, or proof that [appellant] has unilateral authority over the children. Because [appellant] has not submitted any of these documents, the Minister, by decision of 10 August 2014, refused to issue the requested passports for the children. The Minister maintained that decision by decision on objection of 1 October 2014. He also established that [appellant] was married on 5 December 2008 in The Hague to the father of the children and that the marriage was not dissolved under Dutch law. [appellant] and the father of the children therefore jointly have parental authority. The requested documents were also not submitted in objection. [Appellant] submitted a judgment of the Qatari Family Court of April 30, 2014, which she claims follows that she has unilateral parental authority. However, the minister has not given any decisive meaning to that ruling, because it does not follow that [appellant], in accordance with the 'Quatari Law of the Family, no. 22, 2006', based on Islamic law, in addition to the 'custody', it also '. has guardianship over the kids. [appellant] has not brought legal remedies against that decision.

    On 9 February 2016, [appellant] submitted repeated applications for Dutch passports for the children. The minister rejected the applications by decision of 15 March 2016.

He has taken the view that no new facts or changed circumstances regarding the exercise of parental authority have occurred since the previous applications were rejected. According to the minister, the judgment of the Qatari Court of Appeal brought in by [appellant] of April 7, 2015 does not change parental authority. By decision of 20 May 2016, he dismissed the objection lodged by [appellant] against the decision of 15 March 2016 as unfounded. The appeal she lodged against this was declared unfounded by a court decision of 23 September 2016. By judgment of 22 November 2017, ECLI: NL: RVS: 2017: 3218, the Division declared the appeal lodged by [appellant] against this to be unfounded. The Division has considered that the judgment of the Qatari Court of Appeal of April 7, 2015 still pronounced the separation between [appellant] and the father of the children, but that the attacked judgment of the Qatari Family Court of April 30, 2014 the 'custody' has been maintained. In the decision of 1 October 2014 on that part of that ruling, the minister gave the legally established assessment that it does not follow that [appellant] also has the 'guardianship' over the children in addition to the 'custody' and that she therefore does not has one-headed authority over them. In view of this, the ruling of the Qatari Court of Appeal does not change parental authority. The appeal to Qatari law made by [appellant] in the applications of 9 February 2016 also contains no new fact or changed circumstance, because the minister already involved that legislation in decision-making in 2014. Finally, in the applications of 9 February 2016, [appellant] stated that she and the children have lived in Peru since the decisions on the previous applications and that the children received Roman Catholic baptism there in 2015. The minister has reasoned that the change of residence of [appellant] and the children to another country does not mean that the other parent has lost parental authority and that Peruvian law does not change the situation. of parental authority. The court has rightly ruled that the minister was allowed to reject the applications of 9 February 2016 in application of Article 4: 6, second paragraph, of the General Administrative Law Act, according to the Division.

Attacked verdict

3. In the attacked judgment, the court ruled that the Minister was entitled to reject the applications of 28 March 2018 in application of Article 4: 6 (2) of the General Administrative Law Act. Insofar as [appellant] relies on the facts and circumstances referred to under 2. above, these have already been discussed in the previous procedures. The minister has taken the position that the judgment of the Peruvian Family Court of 23 April 2018 submitted in connection with the applications of 28 March 2018 is based on the incorrect or incomplete fact that the children were born out of wedlock. The court, like the minister, assumes that the [appellant] has not disputed the facts that she and the father of the children were married on 5 December 2008 in The Hague and that the divorce was granted by judgment of the Qatari Court of Appeal April 7, 2015 is pronounced. This means that the children were born during the marriage. The court follows the minister in his position that the judgment of the Peruvian judge of April 23, 2018 therefore cannot substantiate that [appellant] has single-headed authority over the children and that this cannot be deduced from the applications made on March 28 2018 submitted Peruvian notarial permissions 'Autorizaci√≥n viaje al exterior' of March 19, 2018.

3 Appeal

4. [appellant] argues that the court wrongly ruled with regard to some of the documents submitted with the applications of 28 March 2018 that they could and should have been submitted prior to the decisions on the previous applications and therefore have not been found to be new. facts or changed circumstances. [Appellant] has already provided evidence in the procedures relating to the previous applications that the father of the children no longer lives in Qatar and the children live with her in Peru and received Roman Catholic baptism there in 2015. In those proceedings, it has also submitted the judgments of the Qatari Family Court of 30 April 2014 and the Qatari Court of Appeal of 7 April 2015. It follows from the ruling of the Qatari Family Court and the Qatari law, which she also appealed to in the appeal procedure regarding the first repeated applications, that in Qatar only a man can have the guardianship over children, which is not the same under understood as 'parental authority' within the meaning of Book 1, Article 245, fourth paragraph, of the Civil Code, and that the 'guardianship' of the father of the children has been lost by operation of law. This evidence supports her claim that the children's father no longer has parental authority over them and that she has one-headed authority. The document "Knowledge Bank Civil Affairs Qatar" was also discussed in the previous proceedings, after it was added to the decision on objection of 1 October 2014, according to [appellant].

4.1. The argument lacks factual basis. The court has ruled that the minister has correctly taken the position that the aforementioned facts and circumstances and the documents submitted for that purpose have already been involved in the decision-making on the previous applications and are therefore not new facts or changed circumstances. The court did not consider that [appellant] should have previously relied on these facts, circumstances and documents.

5. [appellant] refers to the Peruvian notarial authorizations of 19 March 2018 submitted with the applications of 28 March 2018.

The Peruvian identity document of [appellant], stating that she is unmarried, has been taken into account when it was issued. Under Peruvian law, she never married the father of the children, because the marriage was not registered at a Peruvian consulate or in the Peruvian Registro Nacional de Identificacion y Estado Civil. The notary has determined on the basis of the Peruvian birth certificates of the children that their father has not recognized them. In view of this, [appellant] has one-headed authority over the children under Peruvian law. This also follows from the judgment of the Peruvian Family Court of April 23, 2018.

This statement is based on correct information, since she was never married to the father of the children under Peruvian law, according to [appellant].

5.1. The judgment of the Peruvian Family Court of April 23, 2018 has no formal legal force under Dutch law. The Division agrees with the court that the minister has been allowed to take the position that this judgment is not assigned the meaning that [appellant] wishes, since it contains the opinion that she has unilateral authority over the children. assumed that these were born out of wedlock. It is not in dispute that, as the Minister has stated, under Dutch law [appellant] and the father of the children were married at the time of the birth of the children and that the children were therefore born during the marriage. Furthermore, the court has rightly ruled that the minister did not have to regard the Peruvian notarial authorizations as evidence of the [appellant's] one-headed authority over the children, now that it only follows that she has permission to travel abroad with the children. . The fact that, as [appellant] claims, this authorization under Peruvian law is only issued if the other parent has died or the child has not been recognized does not lead to a different judgment. The authorizations were issued on the premise that [appellant] was never married to the father of the children and that the children were not recognized by him. The minister has been able to take the position that the authorizations do not change the joint parental authority that arose under Dutch law through the birth of the children during the marriage. The above does not change the fact that, as [appellant] claims, under American law no joint parental authority has arisen over them when the children were born because the marriage was not reported in the birth declaration in the United States. The court has correctly ruled that the minister [appellant] has been entitled to reject applications of 28 March 2018 for the granting of a Dutch passport to the children in application of Article 4: 6 (2) of the General Administrative Law Act.

    The argument fails.

5.2. The minister has explained that [appellant] can submit a request to the District Court of The Hague for replacement permission to issue Dutch passports for the children. She can also apply to the competent Peruvian court with a request for the granting of unilateral authority over the children, stating that under Dutch law joint parental authority arose when the children were born.

6. The appeal is unfounded. The attacked decision needs to be confirmed.

7. There is no reason for a court order against costs.
