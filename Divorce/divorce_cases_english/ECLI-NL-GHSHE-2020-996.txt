Family and youth law team

Verdict: March 19, 2020

Case number: 200.256.580 / 01

Case number first instance: 7247857 BM VERZ 18-4011 and 7247887 BM VERZ 18-4013

in the appeal case of:

[appellant] and [appellant],

residing in [place of residence],

appellants,

hereinafter referred to respectively as [appellant] and [appellant],

(former) lawyer: mr. N. Kammers,

the following are considered interested parties:

- the administrator; [administrator] (hereinafter: the administrator).

1 Proceedings
For the course of the proceedings in the first instance, the court refers to the order of the court of Limburg, Maastricht seat, of 27 December 2018.

The appeal proceedings
2.1.
By appeal with exhibits, received at the Registry on March 18, 2019, appellants have requested that the aforementioned decision be annulled insofar as the requests regarding the administration have been rejected, on the understanding that the administrator will be dismissed with the simultaneous appointment of a subsequent administrator.

2.2.
The Court also took note of the contents of:

the minutes of the oral hearing at first instance dated 12 December 2018 and other documents from the first instance, received on 12 April 2019;

a letter from the administrator, received on 4 July 2019;

the V-forms of mr. Kammers of 24 January 2020, with which she withdraws the appeal on behalf of [appellant] and withdraws as [appellant's] lawyer.

2.3.
The oral hearing took place on January 28, 2020. The following were heard on that occasion:

[appellant], assisted by mr. Kammers;

the administrator, represented by [representative of the administrator].

2.4.
In accordance with the agreement, after the hearing on appeal, on January 31, 2020, documents of the administrator regarding the authority to represent the company were received.

2.5.
In addition, after the hearing on appeal, the court requested the intended administrator, mr [successive administrator], and received it on 13 March 2020.

2 Facts
3.1.
[appellant] is married to [appellant] in community of property. By orders of March 27, 2017, the goods that (will) belong to [appellant] and [appellant] have been put under administration as of April 16, 2017 due to their physical or mental condition.

3.2.
In the contested decision, the subdistrict court judge, insofar as relevant here, rejected the request of rightholders to dismiss the administrator and to simultaneously appoint the proposed successor administrator. The mentorship for the benefit of rightholders has been discontinued.

3.3.
Now that the appeal of [appellant] has been withdrawn, the court of appeal assumes that the complaints as far as they refer to [appellant] are no longer maintained. The court will declare titleholders inadmissible in the appeal to the extent that this concerns [appellant]. This means that [administrator] remains the administrator of [appellant].

3.4.
[appellant] cannot agree with the rejection by the subdistrict court of the administrator's request for dismissal and the appointment of a successor administrator.

3.5.
[appellant] briefly summarizes the following in the notice of appeal, and supplemented during the oral hearing on appeal.

Communication between the administrator and [appellant] is very difficult. No questions are answered, no calls are returned and commitments are not kept. Costs are made for the government, while there should be a fee from the municipality. It does not appear from the documents that [appellant] receives this compensation. There is a breach of trust. There are compelling reasons to switch directors. The subdistrict court's consideration that a change of trust will once again be experienced as a breach of trust is not based on anything.

During the oral hearing on appeal, [appellant] added that he no longer actually lives with [appellant] and plans to file for divorce. Two different administrators are necessary for this purpose, according to [appellant].

3 Scope of Dispute
3.6.
The administrator disputed all statements with reasons and explained any uncertainties raised by [appellant]. There is no question of a disturbed or unworkable situation and the administrator is prepared to continue to perform his duties for [appellant]. However, in view of the current developments in which a divorce is to take place, it seems to the administrator that [appellant] and [appellant] each have their own administrator, with a view to a possible conflict of interest. The defense that has been conducted on behalf of the administrator is therefore no longer upheld.

4 Reasons of the Decision
3.7.
The court comes to the following assessment.

3.8.
Pursuant to Article 1: 448 paragraph 1 preamble and under e and paragraph 2 of the Dutch Civil Code (BW), the administrator can be dismissed by the subdistrict court judge, either at his own request, for serious reasons or because he no longer meets the requirements to to become an administrator, at the request of the co-administrator or the person who is entitled to request an administration as referred to in Article 1: 432, first and second paragraphs of the Dutch Civil Code, or ex officio.

3.8.1.
Having regard to the new facts and circumstances which have emerged during the oral appeal, namely that rightholders are in fact divorced, that they intend to file for divorce and that, for these reasons, the administrator no longer objects to the assignment of the request, in the opinion of the court there are serious reasons and the court will still dismiss the administrator and appoint the proposed administrator as successor.

The Court of Appeal does not have sufficient insight into the situation to assess whether the successive administrator may also be entitled to remuneration for initial work in addition to the annual salary. The court recommends the successive administrator, if he wishes to claim this, to turn to the subdistrict court.

The court will also determine that a copy of this order is sent to the registrar of the Limburg court, Maastricht seat, in connection with an entry in the Central guardianship and administration register.
