2 Facts
3.1.
The court of appeal is based on the facts established by the court insofar as no appeal has been brought against it. Among other things, the following has been established:

As confirmed by the oral appeal on appeal, the parties were married in Community property on 28 July 1983 in Warsaw (Poland).

A first divorce petition was filed on April 21, 2015. The divorce was pronounced by order of 20 April 2016. This decision should have been entered in the registers of civil status before 20 January 2017. Neither party has registered the divorce decision, so that it lost its legal force after January 20, 2017.

On March 7, 2017, the woman filed a (second) petition for divorce.

By judgment of 24 November 2017, the Limburg District Court (Maastricht) subsequently pronounced the divorce. The court arrested the case with regard to the division of the matrimonial community. That division was decided by the contested decision.

The divorce decision was entered in the registers of civil status on March 21, 2018.

3 Scope of Dispute
4.1.
The contested decision:

a. the manner of division of the community existing between the parties shall be determined as follows:

is assigned to the woman:

- the apartment at the [address], [postcode] [place];

is assigned to the man:

- the claim on the sellers of the parcel in Poland;

- Aegon Safe policy;

stipulated that the woman will pay an amount of € 8,000 due to excessive payment to the husband

€ 18,633.80;

stipulates that each of the parties is entitled to half of the amount of € 80,000 in deposit with the notary [the notary] in [the place of employment], plus interest and after deduction of the costs;

provides that the Opel Kadett is to be sold and that the net sales proceeds are to be shared equally between the parties;

the decision regarding the distribution declared enforceable in stock;

provide that each party bears its own costs of the proceedings;

the more or otherwise requested rejected.

4.2.
The man requests the court to annul the contested order, insofar as it is subject to the judgment of the court, and to determine again with an conclusive ruling that the division of the matrimonial community must take place as follows:

that the woman is allocated the apartment to the [address], [zip code] [place];

that the man is granted the Aegon safe policy, without the man having to reimburse half of the value to the woman;

that it is stipulated that the woman will have to pay an amount of € 48,590.80 due to excessive payment to the man;

that the man of the amount of € 80,000 in deposit with the notary [the notary] in [the place of employment] is entitled to € 42,500 and the woman an amount of € 37,750 plus the interest and after deduction of the costs, to be shared equally;

that the claim against the sellers of the parcel in Poland was wrongly attributed to the man at a value of € 36,000;

whereas provision should be made for the claim against the sellers of the lot in Poland to be shared equally between the parties if the parties decide to liquidate the claim through a proceeding in Poland;

that the woman must pay a usage fee to the man of € 350 per month for the use of the apartment at the [address] in [place], for the period from March 7, 2017 until the transfer date.

The woman put up a defense. She requests the man to be declared inadmissible in his principal appeal or to dismiss the principal appeal of the man.

4.3.
The woman requests the Court of Appeal to annul the contested decision on an incidental appeal, to the extent that it is subject to the judgment of the Court of Appeal, and to determine again once again that

the Aegon safe policy is allocated to the husband at a value of € 31,835, of which the husband must reimburse half to the wife, taking into account the tax consequences as calculated in paragraph 74 of the defense, at least on the basis of of the most current value;

the man has forfeited his share in the Reaal SNS Policy of € 18,558.33 and that this is therefore entirely due to the woman;

the man to the woman pursuant to the division between parties as determined by the court, with adjustment due to the changes requested from the court, due to over-distribution to the woman will pay an amount of € 4,748.54.

The man defends. He requests the woman to be declared inadmissible in her cross-appeal, or to dismiss her cross-appeal.

4.4.
In principle, the man has lodged five complaints against the contested decision. His grievances relate to the following topics:

the cash withdrawal of € 10,000 (complaint 1);

a monetary amount of € 5,000 (complaint 2);

the parcels in Poland (complaint 3);

the Aegon safe policy (complaint 4);

the usage fee (complaint 5).

4.5.
In her cross-appeal, the woman brought two complaints against the contested decision. Her grievances relate to the following topics:

the Real SNS Policy (complaint 1);

the Aegon safe policy (complaint 2).

4.6.
The court will discuss the grievances in principle and on an incidental appeal per subject.

4 Reasons of the Decision
Cash withdrawal of € 10,000 (complaint 1 of the man)

5.1.
With complaint 1, the man claims an amount of € 5,000 in compensation from the woman. The man argues the following in explanation of his complaint.

Based on art. 1:99 paragraph 3 BW jo. 3: 170 paragraph 3 BW, various acts of the man in the period between April 21, 2015 (the date of submission of the first divorce petition) and January 20, 2017 (the date on which the first divorce decision should have been entered in the registers of civil status) qualified as acts of disposition which he should not have carried out unilaterally. The court has ruled that he acted wrongfully towards the woman, according to which he had to compensate her for the damage suffered by the woman.

In turn, the woman withdrew an amount of € 10,000 from the parties' savings account on 13 January 2015. In accordance with the court's opinion with regard to the acts performed by the man, the man claims that the woman acted unlawfully towards him, on the basis of which she is obliged to compensate him for the damage suffered by the man.

5.2.
The woman put up a defense. The withdrawal by the woman of the amount of money of € 10,000 from the joint savings account of the parties in January 2015 cannot be based on art. 1:99 paragraph 3 BW jo. 3: 170 paragraph 3 of the Dutch Civil Code are qualified as an act of disposition that it should not have performed unilaterally. The withdrawal of the amount of money by the woman also did not take place in the period between April 21, 2015 and January 20, 2017, but well before the submission of the first divorce petition (on April 21, 2015).

5.3.
The court considers as follows.

Contrary to the situation over which the court has decided and on which the husband now relies as the basis for his claim, the withdrawal of the amount of money of € 10,000 from the joint savings account of the parties by the woman is well before the submission of the first filed for divorce. At that time there was no question of a dissolved marriage community. Furthermore, the man has not made clear why the woman was not allowed to withdraw the intended amount of money from the savings account of the parties. The man's claim will therefore be dismissed.

Insofar as the man intended to argue with his complaint that the amount of € 10,000 was still present on the reference date of 7 March 2017, the woman disputed this with sufficient reasons. She pointed out that she lived on the money. The man has not further substantiated his statement against this, nor has he offered any evidence of his statement. Consequently, the man's complaint fails.

Cash amount of € 5,000 (complaint 2 by the man)

5.4.
Grief 2 by the man means the following. The court wrongly took no account of the distribution of the sale proceeds of € 80,000 deposited with the notary, which is due to the parties with regard to the sale of the apartment they owned jointly with their daughter. circumstance that in 2015 the man gave an amount of € 5,000 to the daughter of the parties to repay the mortgage linked to that apartment.

In explaining his complaint, the man argues that for that gift he used the funds that he had redeemed from the Reaal SNS policy, the Rabo investor account share package and the Aegon savings exchange. Now that the court has ruled that the husband should pay compensation to the woman, because he acted wrongfully against her by appropriating himself the funds from the Reaal SNS policy, the Rabo investor share package and the Aegon savings exchange, the court took this into account. must keep to the distribution of the sale proceeds of the apartment of € 80,000.

5.5.
The woman put up a defense. When distributing the sale proceeds of € 80,000, the court rightly did not take into account the statement of the man that in 2015 he gave an amount of € 5,000 to the daughter of the parties to repay the mortgage. The apartment was sold in 2018 and delivered to the buyer on October 31, 2018. The gift to which the man refers was made by him on January 8, 2015 (Exhibit 35). This is well before the submission of any divorce petition and also well before the man appropriated the funds from the Reaal SNS policy, the Rabo investor share package and the Aegon savings exchange. So the extra repayment that the man made as a gift, he made with community money.

5.6.
The court considers as follows.

The court states first of all that the husband stated at the appeal hearing that his complaint is not directed against the judgment of the court that he acted wrongfully towards the woman by himself the means from the Reaal SNS policy, the Rabo investor share package and to appropriate the Aegon savings exchange.

The court understands the man's complaint in such a way that he claims that he is entitled to compensation in respect of the gift to the daughter of the parties.

At the appeal hearing, the man stated that he paid the gift to his daughter of € 5,000 from his salary account. This can also be deduced from the bank statement produced by the woman as Exhibit 35 to her defense. This shows that on 8 January 2015 the man transferred the aforementioned amount of € 5,000 to the daughter of the parties. At that time, the matrimonial community of the parties had not yet been dissolved, even by the first divorce petition of April 21, 2015. This means that the gift to the daughter of the parties was paid out of community funds. There is therefore no question of a right of compensation on the part of the man.

The man has previously stated that the gift of € 5,000 would have been paid from the appropriated funds obtained from the cashing in of the Reaal SNS policy, the Rabo investor share package and the Aegon savings exchange. The woman disputed this with reasons, pointing out that the man obtained the money only after the first divorce petition was filed on April 21, 2015. The man did not persist in his position on the appeal hearing.

The foregoing means that the man's grievance fails.

The plots in Poland (complaint 3 by the man)

5.7.
At the appeal hearing, the parties agreed on the parcels in Poland, agreeing as set out in the agreement annexed to this decision. The court will determine that this agreement is part of the order.

Aegon safe policy (complaint 4 by the man, complaint 2 by the woman)

5.8.
With regard to the Aegon safe policy, the court has considered the following:

“The woman has requested to distribute the policy to the man at a value of € 12,832, with compensation of half of the value to the woman. The woman is of the opinion that the premium paid by the man can be settled until April 2015. The man can continue the policy, so the increase in value is only for him.

The man has argued that it is an annuity policy in the name of the man. The surrender value as at 21 December 2017 is € 8,914 net (€ 31,835 gross), taking into account the tax and revisionary interest, and can be allocated to the man for that value. The man pays a monthly amount of € 100 in premium.

The court has given parties the opportunity to inform the court after the oral hearing about the possibility of splitting or buying off the policy.

The husband subsequently took the position that the policy should be allocated to him, without any further settlement with the woman, since it concerns a supplement to his pension.

The woman wishes to assume the net surrender value of € 8,914. According to the woman, the man changed his position too late.

The court is of the opinion that the man has indeed changed his position late and ignores it. The court is of the opinion that the policy falls in the community and that the woman is entitled to half the value. Now that the man has failed to provide the court with further information about the possibility of a division, the court assumes the man's surrender of the policy at a value of € 8,914 net, now that the woman has agreed to this. An amount of € 4,457.00 is therefore due to the woman.

The man has undisputedly claimed that he has paid the premium and that it must be set off against the woman's share. However, the man has failed to provide a statement of the premiums paid by him so that the court cannot take a decision on this. ”

5.9.
Complaint 4 by the husband means that the court wrongly determined that the husband must pay half of the net surrender value of the Aegon safe policy to him in respect of the Aegon safe policy. The complaint also means that the court wrongly did not take into account the premiums paid by the man. The man argues the following in explanation of his complaint.

The man has Polish nationality and emigrated to the Netherlands at a later age. For this reason, he is not entitled to full AOW when he reaches the age of 67. Because the parties were aware of this, they purchased the Aegon safe policy during the marriage to compensate for the man's lack of AOW.

The ABP pension built up by the man is already shared equally between the parties. It is therefore more than reasonable that the Aegon safe policy is allocated to men, without any further settlement of the value with the woman. After all, the situation will not be the same between the parties as a result of the lack of state pension after the retirement age. Even if the Aegon safe policy is awarded to the man without offsetting, the woman will have more income after she is 67 than the man, based on what was built up during the marriage.

5.10.
The woman put up a defense. She is of the opinion that the court has correctly determined that the husband must pay half of the value to the woman in respect of the Aegon safe policy that has been allocated to him, and that the court has rightly not taken into account the amounts paid by the husband. premiums. The woman disputes that the parties have purchased the Aegon safe policy to bridge any pension gap for the man. It is simply an annuity insurance, intended as an investment in assets. The fact that the ABP pension of the man is equalized is no reason to allocate a part of the dissolved marriage community to the man without deducting its value from the woman. After all, pension equalization has a different legal basis.

5.11.
The court considers as follows.

With regard to the policy, the man wishes to deviate from a division by half and he is entitled to payment by the woman of half of the premiums paid by him in the period January 2015 to 21 December 2017.

With regard to the allocation of the policy to himself without division of the value requested by the man, the court considers the following. Pursuant to art. 1: 100 paragraph 1 of the Dutch Civil Code, the parties have an equal share in the dissolved marriage community. An exception to this main rule can only be made in very exceptional circumstances, which mean that it would be unacceptable, according to standards of reasonableness and fairness, that one spouse pleads against the other half of the dissolved community (cf. HR 30). March 2012, ECLI: NL: HR: 2012: BV1749, NJ 2012/407; HR 20 September 2013, ECLI: NL: HR: 2013: CA3748; HR 22 November 2013 ECLI: NL: HR: 2013: 1393 and HR 9 June 2017 ECLI: NL: HR: 2017: 1066). The divorce petition was filed on March 7, 2017 and thus before January 1, 2018, so that Art. 1: 100 (new) BW does not apply (HR 19 April 2019 (ECLI: NL: HR: 2019: 636)).

In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, there is no room for the intended exception in this case. The woman has argued with sufficient motivation that the parties have taken out the policy to compensate for the husband's lack of AOW, so that it cannot be assumed.

Nor is the circumstance that the husband will receive less AOW pension than the wife a very exceptional circumstance, while also in the light of the further circumstances to which the husband has appealed, the appeal that the wife makes to division by half of the policy in this is not unacceptable by standards of reasonableness and fairness.

To that extent the man's grievance fails.

Subsequently, the husband's entitlement to payment by the wife of half of the premiums paid by him in the period January 2015 to 21 December 2017 is subject to assessment. By letter of 28 September 2019 as Exhibit 2, the man brought into question three proofs of payment, showing that an annual premium of € 1,207.68 was paid in respect of the Aegon safe policy in 2015, 2016 and 2017. The marriage community of parties was dissolved on March 7, 2017. In view of this, the request of the man with regard to the years 2015 and 2016 could only be granted if it were established that the man had paid the premiums referred to here from private funds during those years. However, the man has not demonstrated that, so there is no basis for a right to compensation. However, the court will grant the man's request insofar as his request relates to the premiums paid by him in the period after March 7, 2017. The marriage community of the parties was dissolved on the latter date and the man provided the proof of payment that he submitted. it has been sufficiently demonstrated that in that period (the period after 7 March 2017) he paid the full private equity contributions owed to Aegon by both parties. The woman has not contradicted this either. The husband has thus paid more than he assumed in the relationship with the wife (art. 6:10 BW). The woman is therefore obliged to pay half of the premiums paid by the man in the period March - December, totaling € 905.76 or € 452.88. Thus the court will determine.

5.12.
In short, the woman's complaint 2 means that the court wrongly assumed an amount of € 8,914 for the value of the Aegon safe policy involved in the distribution, of which the man must pay half to the woman (€ 4,457). This amount is too low. In summary, the woman puts forward the following in explanation of her complaint.

The man has not bought the Aegon safe policy. There is no reason for that either, because the man apparently would like to keep that policy for a decent payment later. It is therefore not correct to start from levying revisionary interest, as the court did. This has an unfair value-reducing effect. Even if the insurance was taken out before 16 October 1990 and the premium was not increased thereafter, no revision interest is charged (upon surrender). With reference to point 74 of her defense, the woman takes the view that the husband must pay an amount of € 18,297.17 to her in respect of the allocation of the Aegon safe policy to him.

5.13.
The man put up a defense. He is of the opinion that for the value of the Aegon safe policy, the court has rightly assumed the surrender value of

€ 8,914. In this context, the man refers to the letter from Aegon, which he submitted in the first instance as Exhibit 4, showing that value.

5.14.
The court considers as follows.

It is not disputed by the woman that the man owes tax on the annuity policy. In HR 23 February 2018, ECLI: NL: HR: 2018: 281, the Supreme Court considered:

“The Court of Appeal took the surrender value of the annuity policies on the reference date of 1 March 2009 as the basis for calculating the value to be distributed. This is - albeit fictitious - based on the payment of the value on that date. This means that for the calculation of the tax claim to be deducted from this, it must be assumed that the tax is due on the reference date on the surrender value paid out at that time (cf. HR February 24, 2006, ECLI: NL: HR: 2006: AU6095). ”

Thus, the applicable rate on the reference date, which has been undisputed by the man on 21 December 2017, must be taken into account. There is no dispute between the parties that the tax on the annuity obligation is 52%. The man must pay half of the value of the annuity claim to the woman after deduction of the 52% tax levied thereon.

It follows from the letter from Aegon submitted by the man as Exhibit 4 at first instance that the gross value of the annuity insurance on the reference date is € 31,835. After deduction of the taxation of (52% of 31,835 =) € 16,554.20, the net value is € 15,280.80. It has neither been asserted nor established that the man intends to buy off the annuity insurance before the end date. For this reason, as now that insufficient information has been provided that it appears that revision interest will be charged for this insurance in the event of payment in one installment at the end of the term, revision interest will not be taken into account. The court will therefore order the man to pay the woman an amount of € 7,640.40. To this extent, the woman's complaint succeeds.

Usage fee (complaint 5 from the man)

5.15.
With regard to the apartment owned by both parties at the [address] in [place], which was previously let to third parties, the husband requests a fixed user fee to be paid by the woman as of March 7, 2017 until the date of the transfer. of € 325 per month, being half of the loss of monthly rental income when the apartment was still rented to third parties. The court rejected this request. The man's complaint 5 is directed against this rejection.

5.16.
The woman put up a defense. It is true that the woman uses the apartment, but that was not the former matrimonial home. The apartment has never been used as a (main) residence by the parties. After the parties have split up, the woman has left the marital home and has moved into the apartment of the parties at the [address] in [place]. The man's request for a usage fee must also be rejected, because the man, in short, does not suffer any damage. If it is assumed that the man suffers damage, this should be calculated as usual: a fixed percentage of the man's share in the equity of the apartment. Assuming a percentage of 2.5%, the user fee that may be payable by the woman is € 125,000 / 2 = € 62,500 x 2.5% = € 1,562.50 per year / 12 = € 130. - per month. This should still be deducted from the owner's costs, which are fully borne by the woman, but which, on the basis of his co-ownership, are also partly borne by the man.

5.17.
The court considers as follows.

A user charge is based on Art. 3: 169 BW. This article states t:

"Unless a regulation provides otherwise, each participant is authorized to use a common good, provided that this use is compatible with the rights of the other participants."

It is established that the man has co-ownership of the apartment at the [address] in [place]. He is therefore entitled to use it in addition to the woman. A user fee is granted if the co-owner (here: the man) remains deprived of the use and / or enjoyment of the home to which he is entitled under the partnership. In that case, the husband must be compensated by the wife as a partner who does have this use and enjoyment of the home; she lives in the house. The legislator has deliberately formulated the reservation to the use of a community good (“provided that this use is compatible with the rights of the other partners”) in such a way that it leaves sufficient room for the principles of reasonableness and fairness to apply (MoU II, Parl, Gesch. 3, p. 587).

It is established that after the parties have parted, the woman has left the matrimonial home and has taken up residence in the apartment at the [address] in [place] and that the husband has no longer been able to use and enjoy this apartment. . Therefore, in view of the provisions of art. 3: 169 BW, to compensate the man.

Contrary to what the man advocates, the court assumes a rate of return on the (surplus) value of the apartment and not on the missed rental income for the amount of the user charge. The woman has undisputedly argued that she moved into the apartment with the husband's agreement after the parties split up. In addition, the court allocated the apartment to the woman at its unlet value.

The 2.5% rate of return used by the woman has not been contested by the man. Now that the Court of Appeal considers this percentage to be fair, the Court of Appeal determines the usage fee to be awarded to the man as compensation at half of 2.5% of the (surplus) value of the apartment. There is no dispute between the parties that no mortgage loan has been taken out for this apartment.

For the (over) value of the apartment, the court assumes the value for which the apartment has been allocated to the woman (an amount of € 125,000). Taking this into account, the court establishes the user charge at half 2.5% over € 125,000 = € 1,562.50 per year, being € 130.21 per month until the date of transfer of the apartment. This should be deducted from half of the property tax already paid and still to be paid by the woman (€ 202.52 per year in 2017, € 204.15 per year in 2018 and € 241.73 in 2019), of which not the dispute is that the woman has fully covered this owner's burden since the reference date. The court does not take into account the other costs reported by the woman, now that these costs are (partly) user charges and the woman has not made clear which part relates purely to being the owner.

Real SNS policy (complaint 1 of the woman)

5.18.
The woman states that there is deliberate concealment within the meaning of art. 3: 194 paragraph 2 BW. It concerns the funds from the Real SNS policy of € 18,558.53. The woman has requested that the man be ordered under Art. 3: 194 paragraph 2 BW has forfeited its share in the value of the Reaal SNS policy of € 18,558.33.

5.19.
The man put up a defense. He expressly disputes that he would have withheld the funds from the Reaal SNS policy. The Reaal SNS policy was part of the procedure at first instance. The court also involved the policy in the distribution. Of concealment of the policy as referred to in art. 3: 194 paragraph 2 BW is therefore not the case.

5.20.
The court considers as follows.

The court finds that the court of first instance has included the value of the Reaal SNS policy in the distribution by - in short - convicting the man by means of the wrongful act to pay half of the value of the Reaal SNS policy to meet the woman. The fact that the husband intentionally intended to conceal the money paid to him for the wife is in view of the motivated dispute by the husband, insufficiently substantiated by the wife. For application of art. 3: 194 paragraph 2 BW therefore sees no reason for the court. Therefore the woman's grievance fails.
