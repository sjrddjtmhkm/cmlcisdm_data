“This is to confirm that [erflater] has been a permanent resident of [L], Kenya for at least the past 20 years that I've known him intimately. Over all these years and until well into 2014, he has been a regular customer and visitor of my establishment [N] and he has become a personal friend of me and many other regular customers.

I can attest to the fact that he lived here through the whole year during all those years. He was never absent from Kenya for more than the occasional holiday, and had a very active social life that was completely centered on the [L] community. He was a member of my diving club, making dives all through the year and visiting the club on a practically weekly basis. ”.

- A statement by [O], "Netherlands honorary consul in Mombasa". That statement reads as follows:

“L have known [erflater] as a personnel friend for over ten years to have his residence at [L].”

- A statement from [P] of 7 October 2014. The statement reads as follows:

The work consisted of:

- processing the incoming and outgoing mail

- checking bank statements

- making payments

- and everything else one encounters

Mr [testator] came by about once a year to discuss various matters. ”.

2.13.
Various notarial deeds have been submitted by the inspector. In those notarial deeds, the place of residence of [testator] is always "[place 2]". The inspector also submitted a statement from [testator] to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (IND), stating that [testator] lives in the Netherlands.

2.14.
[testator] was insured in the Netherlands for medical expenses. [testator] was ill for a long time and used health care in the Netherlands. In addition, [testator] received medical treatment in the United Kingdom and Kenya.

2.15.
[testator] has had two dispositions of will made. The first final disposition of property was made on 23 August 2013 before a notary in the Netherlands. The second disposition of will relates to the components of the estate that are located abroad. In the first disposition of will, interested parties, two brothers of [testator], are appointed as legatees.

2.16.
[testator] died on August 20, 2014 in [place 2].

2.17.
On 17 October 2014, an invitation to file an inheritance tax return was sent to the address provided by the contact person (the authorized representative). The deadline for filing a declaration has been set on 19 April 2015.

2.18.
On May 23, 2015, a written request is made to postpone submitting a declaration. This letter includes - among others -:

"Mr [testator] lived abroad and does not leave any inheritance taxed in the Netherlands, so that a provisional assessment is not necessary."

2.19.
In a letter dated May 29, 2015, the inspector announced that a postponement to file a declaration will be granted until June 15, 2015.

2.20.
On 13 July 2015, a system notice to file a declaration will be sent to the authorized representative.

2.21.
Following the system notice and a telephone conversation with the inspector, the contact person sent a letter to the inspector on 10 August 2015, which included:

“Mr [testator] has lived in Kenya since the early 1990s. He lived there and was also a resident taxpayer. There are no assets in the Netherlands that are subject to Dutch inheritance tax. ”.

With this letter, an inheritance tax return form has been returned, in which three heirs are reported and "the heir data" states "[the spouse]". Interested party 1 is mentioned as contact person and executor. The names of interested parties are not included in the data of the heirs.

2.22.
By letter of 18 August 2015, the inspector informed the contact person that an inheritance tax return must be submitted, with reference to the Inheritance Tax 1956 (hereinafter: SW) and Article 4 of the General State Tax Act (hereinafter: AWR).

2.23.
On 31 May 2017, the inspector wrote to interested parties and requested that the inheritance tax return be submitted before 1 July 2017. The subject of the letter is "DECLARATION OF LATEST DEMAND". Reference is made to the consequence of not (timely) submitting a declaration, namely that an assessment is imposed ex officio.

2.24.
Inheritance tax assessments have been imposed on interested parties dated 27 June 2017. The assessments have been imposed ex officio. The inspector assumes an acquisition of € 1,000,000 for each of the interested parties. The amount of each assessment, including tax interest, is € 423,128.

2.25.
The inspector has maintained the assessments in the objections.

2.26.
The court overturned the attacks and the interest decisions.

3 Scope of Dispute
3.1.
The dispute concerns the answer to the following questions:

I. Have interested parties made the required declaration?

II. Have the inheritance tax assessments been correctly imposed?

3.2.
The inspector concludes to confirm the statement of objection. Interested parties conclude that the court's decision is confirmed.

4 Reasons of the Decision
With regard to the dispute

I. The required declaration

4.1.
The inspector takes the position that the burden of proof should be reversed and increased, because stakeholders have not made the required declaration. The inspector primarily takes the position that the inheritance tax return, which is appended to the letter of 10 August 2015, was not made by interested parties, but only by [the wife] (see 2.21). Although that declaration states that there are three heirs, the names of the heirs only contain the name of [the wife]. According to the inspector, this means that interested parties have not filed a declaration, even though they have been invited, reminded and warned to do so.

4.2.
Interested parties argue that they have indeed filed an inheritance tax return. In support of their position, they refer to the aforementioned declaration, which is attached to the letter of 10 August 2015. They further argue that several times it was expressly stated that [testator] lived abroad and that there is no taxable event.

4.3.
With regard to the inspector's primary position on the required declaration, the court considers as follows. If the inspector is (presumably) followed in his opinion that the aforementioned inheritance tax declaration has not (partly) been made by interested parties and that interested parties have therefore not submitted a declaration, this does not lead to the conclusion that interested parties have not made the required declaration. In the letter of 31 May 2017, the inspector gave interested parties the opportunity to file an inheritance tax declaration before 1 July 2017 (see 2.23). However, the inspector imposed the inheritance tax assessments before the expiry of that period. In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, there is no question of a situation in which the required declaration has not been made. By imposing tax assessments before the end of the declaration period, the inspector has deprived interested parties of the opportunity to submit a declaration within the specified period. If the inspector was followed in his position, this would mean that interested parties could not escape the penalty of reversing and increasing the burden of proof for not reporting, although the period had not yet expired. After all, a declaration that is lodged after assessments have been imposed does not result in the reversal and increase of the burden of proof being omitted. The circumstances mentioned by the inspector that (i) a long time has elapsed between the invitation to make a declaration and the imposition of the assessments and (ii) the assessments were imposed shortly before the deadline for making the declaration, do not detract from that.

4.4.
In the event that the inheritance tax return is attributable to interested parties and they have therefore filed a return, the inspector alternatively takes the position that interested parties have declared a tax due that differs absolutely and relatively from the actual tax due.

4.5.
The inheritance tax return attached to the letter of 10 August 2015 does not include any assets or liabilities. A declaration has been made to obtain nil. If the parties (presumably) are followed in their view that interested parties have reported a nil acquisition, then the court also finds that there is no situation where the required declaration has not been made. After all, this requires that, under the normal rules of the obligation to compose and the burden of proof, it can be established that there are deficiencies in the declarations that lead to the tax owed according to the declaration being considered, in isolation and proportionally, considerably lower than the actually due tax. In this case, this means that, under the normal burden of proof rules, it must be determined whether [testator] lived in the Netherlands at the time of his death or during the ten years prior to that. The Court of Appeal is of the opinion that this is not the case and refers to the considerations about the domicile of [testator] below. There is no question of a declaration where the tax owed is both absolute and relatively lower than the actual tax owed, in the absence of a place of residence in the Netherlands. The burden of proof is not reversed and increased.

II. The residence

4.6.
Article 1 (1) SW provides that inheritance tax is to be levied on the value of all that is acquired under inheritance law through the death of someone who lived in the Netherlands at the time of the death.

Article 3 (1) SW states that a Dutch citizen who has lived in the Netherlands and who has died within ten years of leaving the Netherlands (...) is deemed to have lived in the Netherlands at the time of his death (...) .

The question of where a person lives must be assessed according to the circumstances under Article 4 of the AWR. It is important whether the circumstances are such that a lasting bond of a personal nature exists between [testator] and the Netherlands. This lasting bond need not be stronger than the bond with any other country, so that it is not necessary for a residence in the Netherlands that the center of someone's social life is in the Netherlands. It follows from the parliamentary history of the tax residence concept that the legislator did not want to attach special significance to certain (categories of) circumstances, such as, for example, a person's social or economic connection with a country.

4.7.
The inspector takes the position that [testator] lived in the Netherlands at the time of his death or in the ten years prior to that. The acquisition by interested parties under inheritance law is therefore taxed. The burden of proof with regard to the facts and circumstances from which the correctness of this position follows, rests with the inspector.

4.8.
In support of his position, the inspector referred, among other things, to the fact that [testator] and [the spouse] were registered in the Netherlands in the Personal Records Database, to the real estate held in the Netherlands, the presence of family members, medical treatment in the Netherlands and to the expenditure made in the Netherlands.

4.9.
Stakeholders contested the inspector's claims with reasons. For example, stakeholders made a timeline of the whereabouts and travel movements of [testator] in 2013. From that timeframe it follows that [actual testator's stay in the Netherlands was not extensive. The inspector also confirmed this at the hearing of the court. The correctness of the time frame has not been disputed by the inspector (for lack of knowledge). From the content of the file, including the statements under 2.12 and the statements of the brothers during the appeal hearing, it follows that the timeframe for 2013 also provides a representative picture of the actual stay of [testator] in the Netherlands in the ten years prior to 2013. The inspector has not made the contrary plausible.

With regard to registration in the Netherlands in the Personal Records Database, interested parties have substantiated that this registration is related to taking out health insurance in the Netherlands. Interested parties stated during the appeal hearing that [testator] occasionally came to the Netherlands about once a year to go through his file with a Dutch doctor, to draw up a treatment plan and possibly to undergo a few investigations. The duration of the stay depended on the number of examinations and the period for waiting for the results of those examinations. The further implementation of those treatments took place in Kenya. The fact that [testator] has made use of medical care in Kenya has been substantiated by stakeholders. Furthermore, [testator] was treated for melanoma in 2012 in London (United Kingdom).

Interested parties have further argued that the registration in the Personal Records Database and the statement to the IND are related to the fact that [the wife] wished to obtain a residence permit in the Netherlands. That statement is substantiated with reference to a letter from [the wife's lawyer] of 20 February 2013.

With regard to the real estate in the Netherlands that [testator] had at his disposal, interested parties have argued that the real estate was largely acquired within the family, namely from an inheritance. The real estate was never used for active asset management and management was outsourced by [testator] to an asset manager. With regard to the bank balances held, it was stated by interested parties that [testator] preferred to keep most of his assets in the Netherlands, because he did not find Kenya a suitable place for this.

[testator] had family in the Netherlands. For example, stakeholders, the brothers of [testator], lived in the Netherlands. In addition, a daughter also lived in the Netherlands, who was even registered for some time at the same address as [testator]. Interested parties referred in this regard to the residence of two other close relatives, namely another brother and sister. The other brother stayed in Zambia and Kenya, the sister alternately stayed in Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Kenya. During the appeal hearing, interested parties stated that they were often only informed afterwards about the visits of [testator] to the Netherlands. Furthermore, it has been stated that [testator] had no connection with his daughter. The daughter's registration was related to obtaining a study grant and contact with [testator] about this was done through interested parties. Those statements made by interested parties have not been contested by the inspector.

Account statements have been submitted by the inspector. These account statements show that [testator] rented a car from Greenwheels several times. During the appeal hearing, the inspector also stated that he no longer takes the position that [testator] had a car to his name in the Netherlands. The other depreciation is mainly related to subscriptions, fixed costs and maintenance work performed. The inspector has referred to payments in Bruges, but these have been explained by stakeholders with reference to the journey made through Europe. Payment in Amsterdam was made at Schiphol. What is completely missing in the account statements provided are payments related to the basic necessities of life. There are no expenditures for groceries, association memberships or other leisure activities. The account statements therefore do not indicate a lasting link of a personal nature with the Netherlands. The inspector has argued that [testator] had several bank accounts and it is therefore possible that this expenditure was made through other accounts. However, it is up to the inspector to investigate that. The inspector did not do this.

4.10.
In view of the provisions under 4.9, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that the inspector has not complied with the burden of proof on him. Against the reasoned dispute by interested parties, the inspector has failed to demonstrate the facts and circumstances mentioned by him or the facts and circumstances should not be given the weight advocated by the inspector. Therefore, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that [testator] had no lasting personal relationship with the Netherlands at the time of his death and in the ten years before that.

Interim conclusion

4.11.
The appeal is unfounded and the court's decision must be confirmed.

Regarding court registry fees

4.12.
The registrar levies a court registry fee of € 519 on the inspector, because the court confirms the court's decision.

Regarding the legal costs

4.13.
The court orders the inspector to reimburse the costs that interested parties reasonably had to incur in connection with the handling of the appeal to the court, because the appeal brought by the inspector is unfounded.

4.14.
This is based on 3 related cases in which interested parties have been wholly or partially in the right. This concerns the present cases in the name of [interested party 1], number 19/00324 and [interested party 2], number 19/00325 and the case in the name of the heirs of [testator], number 19/00298.

4.15.
The court sets this allowance at 2 (points) x € 525 (value per point) x 1 (factor weight of the case) x 1 (coherence) is € 1,050.

4.16.
Interested parties did not request any further procedural costs reimbursement.

4.17.
In each of the aforementioned cases, the Court of Appeal will award a procedural expense allowance of (total amount: number of cases =) € 350.
