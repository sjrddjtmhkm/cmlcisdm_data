[minor] has been supervised by the GI since May 13, 2019. The supervision order was last extended until 13 May 2020.

3.3.
In the contested decision, declared enforceable, the court authorized the GI to remove [minor] from home in an accommodation of a youth care provider from 10 March 2020 to 13 May 2020.

[minor] has been staying with the Centrale Zorg Groep in [place] since 9 April 2020.

3.4.
The mother cannot agree with this decision and she has appealed against it.

3 Appeal
3.5.
In the appeal, as supplemented during the oral hearing, the mother argues the following. An out-of-home placement should only be deployed after other assistance has been deployed and exhausted. That has not happened. Multisystem therapy has been requested, but it did not take place because [minor] is not antisocial, does not play truant and does not use bad language. A psychological examination has been advised, but the GI has still not taken any action. The reason for the supervision is the lack of contact between [minor] and his father, but nothing has been done about it.

[minor] is very shocked that the GI was waiting for him unannounced at school. He then no longer dared to go to school. Before that time, there was never any question of absenteeism. The school results could be better. [minor] is an adolescent and does mischief with his friends. Everything is placed under a magnifying glass by the supervision.

Dismantling the mother and [minor] is the worst thing to do and will damage [minor]. [minor] sees it as a great punishment that he was taken from his mother. He doesn't understand it either.

The mother feels attacked by the neighbors, by the GI and by her ex-partner. She must defend herself constantly. The GI only believes the reports made by the neighbors (with whom the mother is in a continuing conflict) and her ex-partner (who is doing everything possible to harm the mother). They refuse to see harassment, stalking and manipulation. The mother's broken back is also questioned by the GI.

The manner in which the GI carries out the supervision is not in the interest of [minor] and does not meet the requirements set. The mother and [minor] have lost confidence in the GI. The GI is very negative and offensive to the mother. The mother has now requested the court to appoint another GI.

The GI has set a number of conditions. However, the GP does not want to cooperate with urine tests. He indicates that he never got the impression that the mother is addicted to something. Also at Novadic-Kentron the mother cannot knock on the door now that she is not addicted. There is no offer of help, so the mother does not know which aid she should participate in.

3.6.
In the defense, as supplemented during the oral procedure, the GI puts forward the following. The request was made by the mother to have conversations take place in a location other than at home. However, the GI must come into the home situation of [minor] to see and speak to him in his immediate environment. The mother turns against the supervision, is not fair and does not give a clear insight into the current home situation. She denies the concerns. [minor] is in the middle of a struggle between parents. [minor] has already chosen the mother. The mother involves [minor] in adult matters.

There are concerns about the behavior of [minor] that require further investigation. It is important for [minor] to know that his mother also has a share in the out-of-home placement. Establishing a contact recovery with the father from the mother's home situation is not possible.

The mother tends to put the blame on others and seems unable to look at her own share. Due to the unsafe home situation (with regard to the ex-partner), Safegroup became involved with the mother on the advice of Veilig Thuis. Despite the fact that mother is experiencing a lot of trouble from the situation, she does not follow Safegroup's advice. This does not limit the unsafe situation for [minor] as much as possible.

After the conversation between the GI and [minor] at school, he no longer appeared at school for several weeks. School is concerned about [minor] and notices that the mother trivializes concerns about [minor].

The mother has alcohol problems, as a result of which she is emotionally insufficiently available for [minor]. The local police officer, Safe at Home, the neighbors, the ex-partner and now also Surplus confirm this. During the supervision, reports continue to come in to the GI. The mother was asked whether she would like to have urine tests done by the GP, not whether the GP would assess whether there is an alcohol problem. The mother insists that there is nothing wrong with her, which means that there is still a struggle and there is no cooperation in the interest of [minor].

[minor] was placed on the observation and diagnostics group of the Central Care Group on 9 April 2020. He is observed here for twelve weeks. A psychological examination will also be conducted. After these twelve weeks, advice is given regarding what [minor] needs, both individually and in the home situation. In the meantime, the aid agency ViaNeo will start up in the home situation with both the mother and the father. In the home situation with the mother, it will be examined whether the mother is able to adequately meet the development needs of [minor] and what is needed for this. With regard to the father, it will be examined whether contact recovery between [minor] and father is possible and what is necessary to achieve this.

3.7.
During the oral hearing, the father argues that he can agree to the out-of-home placement. The father has not seen [minor] for a year and a half. According to him, [minor] has got a distorted image of his father.

4 Reasons of the Decision
3.7.
The court considers the following.

3.7.1.
Pursuant to Article 1: 265b paragraph 1 of the Dutch Civil Code (BW), the judge may, at her request, authorize the minor, during the day and night, the certified institution, referred to in Article 1.1 of the Youth Act, which is responsible for carrying out the supervision. place home if this is necessary in the interest of the care and upbringing of the minor or for the examination of his or her mental or physical condition.

3.7.2.
The Court of Appeal is of the opinion that this is the case and considers the following.

The supervision order is not up for debate on appeal. This means that the point of departure is, and moreover it is established, that there is still a situation where [minor] is seriously threatened in his development.

There are serious concerns about the social-emotional, cognitive and identity development of [minor]. [minor] shows transgressive behavior at school and makes statements that are not age-appropriate. In addition, there is a loyalty conflict. [minor] rejects any contact with his father and seems to have chosen his mother. There are also serious concerns about his parenting environment.

Mother argues that the reports of the neighbors and ex-partner, with whom she all has a bad relationship, are wrongly assumed to be true, but it is established that the police, school and Safe Home have also expressed concerns about [minor] and the situation he is in. For example, [minor] shows worrying behavior at school and the school is of the opinion that regular education is not suitable for him. Reports have been made from the police about the mother's excessive alcohol consumption and the mother's neglect of [minor].

The mother does not show that she recognizes the concerns. According to her, [minor] only refers to adolescent behavior and mischief. In addition, she denies that she has alcohol problems, but does not take concrete actions to address the concerns about alcohol consumption, for example by having urine tests performed. The GP's statement only mentions that the mother has not been at her office until then because of alcohol and / or drug problems. This does not indicate that the GP was not prepared to carry out urine tests.

The mother says that she is open to assistance and to a psychological examination with [minor], but previous assistance has not started precisely because the mother has no request for help and sees no concerns about [minor]. It is therefore not expected that outpatient care as suggested by the mother will suffice. In view of the history, there is insufficient confidence that the mother accepts the assistance.

[minor] was placed on the observation and diagnostics group of the Central Care group on 9 April 2020. [minor] is observed here for twelve weeks regarding his behavior. During this period, a PO will also be taken from [minor]. After these twelve weeks, the Central Care Group will issue advice regarding what [minor] needs, both individually and in the home situation. The Court of Appeal considers it important that this observation and the investigation take place in the safe and structured environment of the group where he currently resides. The observation and the research should clarify whether the concerns about [minor] are caused by child problems of [minor] or are (partly) caused by the environment in which [minor] grows up in the mother's home situation, of which the constant struggle between the parents is part. On the basis of the research results, it must be considered what care is required for [minor] and his parents to enable a return of [minor] to his mother. During this period, the mother can demonstrate that she accepts ViaNeo's care and that stability in her living situation also remains. The possibilities of contact recovery with the father must also be investigated and [minor] must be enabled to form an independent opinion about (the contact with) his father.

3.8.
The foregoing means that the contested decision must be ratified.
