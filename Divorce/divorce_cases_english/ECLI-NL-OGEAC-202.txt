2 Facts

2.1.
The following facts will be regarded as definite between the parties in this case. These facts are evident from documents submitted and / or follow from statements of the parties insofar as they have been brought forward by one party and have been acknowledged by the other party or have not been contested or have been insufficiently substantiated.

a. The parties married on 24 October 1985 in community property.

The divorce between the parties was pronounced by order of 11 February 2011. It was also ordered to proceed to the division of the matrimonial property community, with the appointment of civil-law notary A.M.P. Eshuis or one of his deputies in case the parties did not agree on the choice of a notary within a month of the decision. Furthermore, the living allowance to be paid by the man was set at NAf 400 per month.

The marriage was dissolved on April 21, 2011 by registration of the divorce decision in the register of the Registry Office.

Since 1 May 2015, the man has received a pension payment of NAf 4,726.42 net (including life allowance) from the General Pension Fund of Curaçao (hereinafter: APC). For the benefit of pension sharing, an amount of NAf 700 is deducted from this.

Since September 2015, the woman has been paid an amount of NAf 700.00 by way of pension distribution.

In addition, as a result of the executory third-party seizure under APC that she has charged her husband, the woman receives a living contribution of NAf 400 directly from the APC.

By letter of June 21, 2018, the woman asked the man to participate in the distribution of the pension rights built up by the man.

3 Scope of Dispute
in convention

3.1.
After her last claim change in the reply, the woman claims to be as practicable as possible in stock:

“I primary: to allocate to him the pension rights accrued by the man as of May 5, 2015 under the order of the man to pay the woman, an amount of NAF 3,223.37 monthly, being half of the monthly gross pension, as long as this pension is paid to him, or if this is not attributable, allocation to the woman of 50% of the value of the pension (gross) at once, both claims with a penalty of NAF 250 per day for each the day on which he remains in default after service of the judgment to be rendered in this respect and after settlement of the amount referred to under point 9 above;

II in the alternative: sentencing the man to order the General Pension Fund of Curacao to transfer half of the monthly pension (including indexations) directly to her into an account with Banco di Caribe, numbered 323293-01 at in particular from [claimant], all this with effect from 1 May 2015 and as long as the pension payment continues with a penalty of NAF 250 per day for every day that he remains in default after service of the judgment to be rendered and settled of the amount referred to under point 9 above;

III recommend that the man provide the applicant with the annual statements for 2016, 2017 and, where possible, 2018, regarding the pension benefits provided by APC, free of charge.

IV. Order the man to pay the costs of the proceedings.

V [additionally] or - if the division is ordered by the Judge - to oblige the man to pay a surrender amount to be imposed by way of distribution of pension rights, or to pay the community at the woman's first request under an amount to be paid by the woman. point to an insurer established in Curaçao; all claims enforceable with stock and legal costs. "

3.2.
The woman bases the claim on the following. Now that the parties have not agreed on a different distribution, the pension rights must be divided between the parties in accordance with the Boon / Van Loon judgment. The amounts claimed under I and II must be set off against the amount of NAf 700 that the woman has received monthly since September 2015. With unconditional allocation, the woman is willing to waive her right to a living contribution. The woman requests access to the amount of the gross pension benefits paid to the man in 2016, 2017 and 2018 and to this end invokes the right of inspection under Article 843a DCCP. Because the wife was unnecessarily hunted for costs because the husband was unwilling to cooperate with the division, despite the fact that the parties are ex-spouses, she requests that the husband be ordered to pay the costs.

3.3.
The man has raised the following in defense. The husband is not obliged to cooperate in a partial division and division while the wife does not mention the other assets. The advanced court costs order is not justified. The man's failure to respond to a one-time letter cannot be considered a refusal. The division of property must take into account the advance on the husband's pension that the woman has received since September 1, 2015 and the husband's repayments on the mortgage debt (since March 25, 2011 to October 24, 2018: NAf 148,232.77), a loan from ACU (NAf 23,879.62 in total) and a loan from RBC (NAf 16,289.02 in total).

in convention

3.4.
The man claims in counterclaim - after changing his claim by rejoinder - to determine the distribution as much as possible in stock as follows:

- “being allocated to [defendant] of i. the present value of the pension accrued with APC, ii. the debt to the RBC bank attn. [defendant], iii. the debt to bailiffs office Curaçao t.n.v. [defendant] and iv. the debt to ACU on behalf of [defendant];

- further allocation to [claimant] of i. the debt to MCB in the name of [claimant] and ii. the debt to ACU on behalf of [claimant];

- with payment by [claimant] to [defendant] of the amount of ANG 54,042.38, which is the result of the settlement of the claims between Parties concerning i. the distribution of [defendant] ex distribution, ii. advance payments ex pension payment [defendant] to [claimant], iii. the repayments made by [defendant] of the debt to Curaçao Bailiff's Office in the name of. [defendant], iv. the repayment of APC's debt due to [defendant] [defendant] and v. the repayment terms paid by [defendant] regarding RBC debt in the name of [defendant];

- further determine that the judgment to be rendered will replace the notarial deed of distribution, as referred to in Article 3: 300 BW.

- legal costs. "

3.5.
The woman has put up a defense against the man's claims.

3.6.
Insofar as relevant, the statements of the parties will be discussed below.

4 Reasons of the Decision
4.1.
If participants cannot reach an agreement on the distribution of common goods, the court can determine the manner of distribution thereof on the basis of art. 3: 185 paragraph 1 of the Civil Code. As stated in that article, due account should be taken of the interests of the parties and the public interest in fairness. Taking the above into account, the Court will divide the community of parties in the manner to be determined below.

reference date

4.2.
Since the marriage of the parties dissolved before the entry into force of the new matrimonial property law as of 1 January 2012, under the applicable transitional law, the legal reference date for determining the size and composition of the dissolved matrimonial community is the date of registration of the divorce decision in the registers of the civil status, in this case April 21, 2011.

size and composition

4.3.
The parties agree that on the reference date the matrimonial community consisted of the following components:

assets

1. The present value of the man's pension to be set off against the woman;

liabilities

2. A personal loan with RBC Bank in the name of the man whose outstanding balance on February 4, 2011 was NAf 33,652.87;

3. The mortgage debt transferred to Deurwaarderskantoor Curaçao of which the outstanding balance on March 24, 2011 was NAf 168,095.31;

4. A personal loan with the ACU in the name of the man whose outstanding balance on the reference date was NAf 23,879.62;

5. A personal loan with MCB Bank in the name of the woman whose outstanding balance on April 29, 2011 was NAf 28,306.60;

6. A personal loan from the woman in the ACU in whose name the outstanding balance on March 22, 2011 was NAf 9,728.35.

retirement

4.4.
Pursuant to Boon / Van Loon (HR 27 November 1981, ECLI: NL: HR: 1981: AG4271, NJ 1982/502), the pension rights accrued by the parties before and during the marriage must be divided. In this distribution, the rules that the Supreme Court has formulated in this judgment must be observed. These rules mean that the distribution must take place in the form of settlement of the value of the pension rights built up before and during the marriage. The method of settlement of the pension rights must take place on the basis of reasonableness and fairness. In general, two methods are usual in this respect: 1) a one-off payment of the cash value, or 2) a pension split by half after the pension commences, amounting to a monthly amount.

4.5.
The man has submitted a statement from the APC dated 8 July 2015, which shows that the capitalized value of the pension rights built up by the man on 21 April 2011 is NAf 475,099.- and the capitalized value of the woman's share in it (taking into account with her special survivor's pension) NAf 180,787. This statement is taken as a starting point, since substantive objections to the correctness of those calculations have not been sufficiently motivated by the woman. In accordance with the judgment to which the woman has referred, the APC has rightly included in the settlement the survivor's pension due to the woman that - as it is by its nature devoted to the woman - is not eligible for distribution (cf. ECLI: NL : PHR: 2004: AO6998 regarding the cross-appeal).

duration surcharge

4.6.
The woman has rightly said that the duration supplement must also be included in the distribution of pension rights. This is because there are rights that already existed as conditional claims at the time of the dissolution. In other words: those rights were built up before the time of dissolution. Although they were not built up by means of premium payment, they were built up because the man met the conditions referred to in the circular of April 7, 1981 during a period before the time of the dissolution (ie before April 21, 2011). that circular was released before April 21, 2011. It must also be assumed that there is a "not negligible relationship" with the woman as referred to in the Boon / Van Loon judgment, on the same footing as would have been if the premium had been paid during the marriage (or before) for the accrual of pension entitlements. (see ECLI: NL: OGHACMB: 2017: 118 and ECLI: NL: HR: 2000: AA7690)

4.7.
According to the APC statement, the "marriage" duration supplement that is related to the total retirement pension that has been accrued during the marriage period on April 21, 2011 is NAf 11,028 per year. Concrete circumstances under which a different formula than that used in calculating the present value of the old-age pension should be applied for this part of the pension have not been invoked. With due observance of that formula, the present value of the "nuptial" duration bonus is deemed to be (11,028 x 10.87828 =) NAf 119,965.67.

4.8.
The above conclusion is that, in the case of a one-off payment of the present value of the full pension benefit, in principle an amount of NAf 240,769.83 (NAf 180,787 + ½ x 119,965.67) should be allocated to the woman.

deduction advance

4.9.
The parties agree that the amount due to the wife in the context of the division of the husband's pension must be deducted from the amount of NAf 700 per month paid by the APC to the woman as of September 2017, as an advance. are being brought. To date, the amount to be deducted is NAf 37,800 (54 months x 700), plus the amounts still to be received by the woman up to the actual distribution of the pension rights.

mutual obligation to pay liabilities

4.10.
It is stipulated that debts are not eligible for distribution now that a debt is not a good as referred to in Section 3: 182 BW. Moreover, it is not possible to make changes to the liability of the parties towards creditors laid down in Section 1: 102 of the Dutch Civil Code by means of distributive acts. In the mutual relationship between the parties, each of them must contribute half of the debt unless agreed otherwise (Article 1: 100 BW) or if a different obligation to contribute applies on grounds of reasonableness and fairness. If, finally, one of the parties, addressed by the creditor, has contributed more in the debt than the part that concerns him, he has a right of recourse against the other party for the excess (Article 6:10 of the Dutch Civil Code). Now that the man in the counterclaim has claimed to include the debts in the distribution, these will be "divided" in the sense that the mutual obligation of the parties for those debts is determined.

4.11.
The fact that the parties are each half liable for the amount of the debts mentioned under 2 to 6 on the reference date 21 April 2011 is no longer in dispute.

4.12.
With regard to the debts in the man's name, based on the available data, the balances mentioned under 4.3 are used. Assuming that the husband will fully repay these debts - insofar as this has not yet been done - the husband will have a recourse claim against the wife of NAf 112,814 .-- (33,652.87 + 168,095.51 + 23,879.62 = 225,628: 2) .

4.13.
With regard to the debts in the woman's name, on the basis of the available data, the balances mentioned under 4.3 are used. Assuming that the woman will repay these debts - insofar as this has not yet been done - the woman will have a recourse claim against the husband of NAf 19,017.48 (28,306.60 + 9,728.35 = 38,034.95: 2).

in summary

4.14.
In summary, the foregoing leads to the following conclusions:

- The husband must pay NAf 240,769.83 to the woman with regard to setoff of the pension, to be set off with NAf 37,800 in advances and the advances still to be received by the woman up to the actual distribution of the pension rights;

- Assuming that the parties will each repay the debts in their name, the man will - after settlement - have a recourse claim against the woman of NAf 93,796.52 (112,814 - 19,017.48).

method of distribution and settlement

4.15.
The man wishes to offset the pension rights by paying a one-off payment of the present value of the pension to the woman. In that case, the man must - after settlement - still pay the woman an amount of NAf 109,173.31 (= 240,769.83 - 37,800 - 93,796.52) minus the amount up to the actual distribution of the pension rights by the woman. advances received. However, the man has not commented on whether he is able to pay a lump sum for this. The man will have to comment on this in more detail.

4.16.
The woman has maintained her primary claim under I to offset the pension rights by means of a periodic payment (whether to be paid directly to her by the APC). She has not commented on how she will settle the man's recourse claim in respect of the Community's debts in that situation. A calculation of the APC showing the amount of the periodic benefit due to the woman has not been submitted. For the time being, however, it does not seem likely that the arrears from the date on which the man became a pensioner will be sufficient to settle the recourse claim. The woman will also be given the opportunity to comment further on this.

4.17.
In the event of set-off of the pension rights by means of a periodic payment, the man will have to be given the opportunity to bring into question, by deed, a calculation of the APC from which the amount of the woman's monthly entitlement to her share in the APC- pension of the man as of the retirement date.

continuation of the comparation of the parties

4.18.
The General Court will order a continuation of the preliminary hearing of the parties to discuss (exclusively) the manner of distribution and set-off. This competition will also be used to investigate whether an amicable settlement can still be reached. If no (full) agreement is reached on the competition, a final judgment will in principle be given after the competition. With a view to this, parties are asked to prepare themselves thoroughly for the appearance of the parties and, if possible, to coordinate this beforehand.

4.19.
Any further decision is reserved.

5 Decision
The court:

5.1.
orders an appearance by the parties to discuss the method of distribution and settlement and to try out an amicable settlement, at the town hall, Wilhelminaplein 4, on Friday 20 March 2020 at 9:15 am in front of the said judge;

5.2.
keeps any further decision.

This judgment was rendered by Mr. F.V.L.M. Wannyn, judge, and delivered in open court on March 2, 2020 in the presence of the Registrar.
