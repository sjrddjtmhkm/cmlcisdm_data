In a defense with exhibits, received at the registry on March 19, 2020, the father requested the court to ratify the contested decision.

2 Facts
3.1.
The marriage of the mother and the father, which has meanwhile been dissolved by divorce, was - insofar as relevant here - born on [date of birth] 2003 in [place of birth] [minor] (hereinafter referred to as [minor]).

3.2.
[minor] has been under GI supervision since November 16, 2017. The supervision order was last extended until May 16, 2020.

3.3.
In the contested decision - declared enforceable - the court authorized the GI to [minor] from 28 February 2020 until

May 16, 2020 to leave home in an accommodation of a youth care provider.

3.4.
The mother cannot agree with this decision and she has appealed against it.

3 Reasons of the Decision
3.5.
The court gave the minor [minor] the opportunity to express her opinion. The Court of Appeal understood that after the contested decision, [minor] ran away from home and went into hiding. Although [minor] is aware of the court's invitation to a child conversation, she does not feel free to come to court. She is apparently afraid that she will be placed directly in a family home.

On the basis of the documents submitted, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that a conflict of interest within the meaning of Section 1: 250 of the Dutch Civil Code (BW) occurs in relation to [minor]. In addition, the court finds it very important that [minor] be heard. To give her a voice in the present proceedings, the court therefore considers it necessary that a special trustee be appointed who can represent her in court.

3.6.
Mr. M.A. Breewel-Witteveen, a lawyer in Roosendaal, is prepared to act as special receiver in these proceedings and will be appointed by the court for this purpose.

3.7.
The mother, the father, the GI and the council have been informed by telephone by the court of the intention of the court to appoint a special trustee.

3.8.
The special receiver must hear on behalf of the court [minor] about the present case and report this back to the court. The special receiver is requested to hold a meeting with [minor] for this purpose. Partly in view of the current situation in connection with the corona crisis and the related announced measures, this can be done by telephone or via Facetime, Skype or similar channels.

The special receiver is requested to submit a report of its findings.

This is allowed in a written report, but can also be done orally during the (telephone) oral hearing to be planned at the court.

If the special receiver sees reason to do so, she is also free to issue an advice in this regard to the court.

Now that the Court of Appeal does not grant the special receiver an order to investigate, as it usually does, the Court of Appeal suffices to indicate that the special receiver will be expected to provide advice in that case. that the grounds on which the advice is based are explained in a clear and consistent manner.

3.9.
In connection with the foregoing, the Court of Appeal held the oral hearing previously scheduled for March 24, 2020 at 2:30 PM.

3.10.
The foregoing implies that it is decided as follows. In addition, the court reserves any further decision.
