1 Proceedings

In a writ of 9 September 2019, [Vrouw Een] brought an appeal in time against a judgment of the parties handed down by the preliminary relief judge in the court in The Hague.

August 26, 2019 (hereinafter: the contested judgment). In addition, [Woman ONE] raised four complaints. In response to productions, [Vrouw TWEE] contested the complaints. Subsequently, [Woman ONE] submitted the documents and requested a judgment. Thereafter, the Court of Appeal gave [Woman ONE] the opportunity to respond by reply to the productions submitted by response. [Woman ONE] did that on November 12, 2019.

2 Facts
2.1.
The facts established in the contested judgment are not in dispute. The court will also assume this. Insofar as relevant in appeal, the following concerns.

2.2.
Parties have been married. By oral decision of March 21, 2019, elaborated in writing in the official report of April 3, 2019, the divorce between them was pronounced and the following was determined, inter alia:

The court

[…]

 understands that the parties have agreed that the former marital home at the [address] will be allocated to [Woman ONE] for a value of € 385,000, as well as the associated mortgage debts and the savings and growth policy linked to the mortgage under the provided that [Woman ONE] ensures discharge from the joint and several liability of [Woman TWO] of the mortgage debts related to the house at the [address]. [Woman ONE] meets [Woman TWO] an amount due to over-distribution equal to half the value of the house minus the amount of the mortgage loan […], being a total amount of € 163,500.00;

[…]

 declares this ruling enforceable with stock, with the exception of divorce.

2.2.
[Woman ONE] has appealed against this. This procedure is still ongoing.

3 Appeal
2.3.
On 17 July 2019, the bulk of the aforementioned official report was served on [Woman ONE]. In addition, [Woman ONE] was ordered to pay the principal of € 163,500.00 plus costs within two days after July 17, 2019. Subsequently, at the end of July 2019, a third-party attachment was charged against [Woman ONE] on behalf of [Woman ONE] among the banks ABN AMRO, ING, NIBK and Robeco.

2.4.
[Woman ONE] subsequently summoned [Woman TWO] to interlocutory proceedings and, inter alia, demanded - in short - to order [Woman TWO] to cancel the seizures. The claims of [Woman ONE] were rejected in the contested judgment. The process costs have been compensated for this.

2.5.
[Woman ONE] requests on appeal that the Court of Justice set aside the contested judgment and once again reassigns her claims in a judgment to be declared enforceable. [Woman ONE] is progressing in the petitum thus, briefly summarized:

a. Order [Woman TWO] to strike out the attached herds;

b. suspension of the enforcement of the judgment of 21 March 2019;

c. Order [Woman TWO] to pay an advance of € 2,500 to [Woman ONE];

d. Order [Woman TWO] to pay the costs of both instances.

2.6.
After [Woman ONE] issued the apple summons, [Woman TWO] collected the full principal plus costs via the third-party attachment under ABN AMRO and ING on 11 September 2019. All seized seizures were subsequently lifted.

2.7.
[Woman TWO] argues in her response that [Woman ONE] no longer has any (urgent) interest in her appeal and primarily concludes that [Woman ONE] is declared inadmissible. In the alternative, [Woman TWO] argues in substance and claims that the appeal be dismissed as unfounded, with [Woman ONE] ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings, because [Woman ONE] continued the appeal despite the fact that the execution was already on 11 September 2019. completed.

4 Reasons of the Decision
3.1.
Partly in view of the defense of [Woman TWO], the Court of Appeal must first assess whether [Woman ONE] still has a sufficient (urgent) interest in the claimed provisions. It has been found that [Woman TWO] has successfully successfully collected the principal plus costs of [Woman ONE] and that the attached attachments have now been lifted (see 2.6 above). Therefore, [Woman ONE] no longer has an (urgent) interest in the claimed provision under a. With regard to the claim under b. applies that a suspension of the enforcement of a judgment can only refer to a suspension with effect from the date of the decision in that regard and not retroactively. Now that the decision has already been implemented, the urgency of the claim under b. come to pass. In the writ of summons, [Woman ONE] claims that a ban be imposed on new attachments to be charged to [Woman ONE] on pain of a penalty. However, this claim is not reflected in the petition. Be that as it may, [Woman ONE] has said too little to assume that there is a good chance that new herds from [Woman TWO] might follow. The court therefore ignores this.

3.2.
Under c. [Vrouw Een] claims an advance on compensation for damage as a result of the wrongful seizure that she has alleged. However, this procedure concerns disciplinary measures under Article 254 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Rv). An urgent interest in the claimed provision is required. [Woman ONE] has not stated that she has an urgent interest in an advance. Nor does an urgent interest follow from its nature.

3.3.
The conclusion is that the appeal already fails for the above reasons and that the contested judgment will therefore be upheld.

3.4.
The present proceedings relate to the settlement of the divorce of the parties. In view of article 237 paragraph 1 DCCP, it is customary in these types of cases to offset the legal costs. [Vrouw Een] did not file a complaint against the compensation of costs at first instance, so that the court will reject this part of the claim.

With regard to the costs of the proceedings on appeal, there is also insufficient reason in the court's opinion not to compensate the costs of the proceedings. The Court of Appeal notes that the appeal appeals do not solely relate to the cancellation of attachments. The court will therefore determine that each party bears its own legal costs.

5 Decision
The Council:

4.1.
ratifies the contested judgment;

4.2.
compensates the costs of the appeal on appeal so that each party bears its own legal costs;

4.3.
rejects the more or otherwise advanced.

This judgment was given by mrs. S.H.M. van der Heiden, E.A. Mink and A. Zonneveld and was pronounced in public hearing on December 10, 2019 in the presence of the registrar.
