2.6.
The oral hearing took place on February 12, 2020. Parties have appeared in person, assisted by their lawyers.

2 Facts
The court of appeal is based on the facts established by the court insofar as no appeal has been brought against it. Among other things, the following has been established.

- The parties were married on 5 June 1998 in the legal community of property.

- Two, meanwhile adult, children were born from the marriage of the parties.

- [applicant] filed for divorce on 1 May 2017 with the court in Limburg, seat Roermond.

- Divorce was pronounced in the contested decision.

- The divorce decision was entered in the registers of civil status on 4 November 2019.

3 Scope of Dispute
4.1.
In the contested decision, the court also determined, insofar as it is currently relevant, that [defendant] must pay € 639 per month to [applicant] as living allowance and the (method of) distribution of the existing parties matrimonial community as set out in the operative part of that order.

4.2.
The parties disagree with this decision and have appealed against it.

4.2.1.
[applicant] raised three complaints against the decision. These complaints concern:

- the contribution of [defendant] to [daughter's] costs (complaint I);

- the gift agreement (complaint II);

- the invoices (complaint III).

[applicant] requests the contested decision to be set aside as far as the amount of spousal maintenance and the amount related to the division of the (dissolved) marriage community are concerned, and that:

- [respondent] will pay her an amount of € 1,340 per month with regard to partner maintenance as of [date of birth] 2019;

- an amount of € 30,100 must be paid to her before the parties distribute the remaining value of the assets in the matrimonial community;

- [defendant] pays her an amount of € 1,500 in respect of advanced costs relating to the house.

At the oral hearing, the applicant withdrew her third complaint, so that it does not need to be examined. The court will reject the request of [applicant] with regard to the advanced costs.

4.2.2.
[defendant] put forward a defense and requested that the requests of [applicant] be rejected.

It raised one complaint against the contested decision. This concerns the loan agreement.

[defendant] requests the contested decision to be set aside in so far as it concerns the dismissal of her claim against [applicant] of the amounts transferred by her to her father in the amount of € 15,000 and, again, to the fullest extent feasible with stock to determine that [applicant] will pay [defendant] primarily an amount of € 15,000, alternatively an amount of € 7,063.58 and more alternatively an amount of € 413.93.

For the rest, [defendant] requests that the contested decision be ratified.

4.3.
The court will discuss the grievances in principle and on an incidental appeal per subject.

4 Reasons of the Decision
Spousal maintenance (complaint I)

5.1.
When determining spousal maintenance, the court took into account the children's costs of a total of € 608 per month (ground 2.4.5.).

Complaint I of [applicant] is opposed to this. She argues that, now that daughter [daughter] has turned 21 on [date of birth] 2019, various costs have been canceled, so that this must no longer be taken into account when determining the defendant's ability to pay. She further argues that she and her parents pay a monthly amount to [daughter] until [daughter] starts working. According to [applicant], [daughter] gets what she needs and does not need to be recorded separately.

5.2.
[Respondent] argues that she has an agreement with [daughter] that she will continue to support her financially from the age of 21. According to her, this is not a non-committal gift, but a clear commitment that [daughter] can also keep her. She takes the position that the amount of € 639 per month determined by the court should be maintained.

5.3.
The court considers as follows.

Each of the parties claims to contribute to the cost of living and study of [daughter], who is expected to complete her studies in June 2021. [defendant] has also substantiated that it now contributes to those costs, which is not disputed between the parties either. The court understands from the statements of the parties that both [applicant] and [defendant] take the position that [daughter] still needs a contribution to support her. In that given situation, the Court of Appeal considers it appropriate that the contribution that [defendant] makes during the period that [daughter] is still studying, be taken into account when determining her capacity. Complaint I by [applicant] fails.

The gift agreement (complaint II)

5.4.
Complaint II by [applicant] means that the court wrongly failed to take into account the content of the gift agreement (grounds 2.5.27 and 2.5.28), which it brought on appeal as Exhibit 3. The applicant submits the following to explain her complaint.

It follows from the gift agreement concluded between her and her parents that (i) gifts were made during the parties' marriage (up to an amount of

€ 30,100) and that ii) these donations do not fall in the matrimonial community. The donations have always been deposited into her private account. The amount of € 30,100 must therefore be paid to her.

5.5.
The [defendant] maintains that the grant agreement brought by [the applicant] is not legally valid and it disputes the existence of an exclusion clause. In summary, it puts forward the following.

The alleged donation agreement is unknown to her. She never saw it, while the parties lived together for quite some time. She never signed the donation agreement; it must be counterfeit. It has previously happened that [applicant] has signed her without the knowledge of [defendant].

The donation agreement was probably only recently drawn up for the purpose of this procedure. Indications for this are that the gift agreement is submitted for the first time on appeal, that no documents (emails, letters or other messages) have been submitted about its realization and the special content of the gift agreement: initially, according to the agreement, € 100, - donated per month and after one year and eleven months € 200 per month. It appears that the amounts have been identified ex post and the donation agreement has been aligned accordingly.

It is for [applicant] to prove that the grant agreement was drawn up in 2002 and that it was [defendant] who signed the signature.

If the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that there has been a loan under exclusion, then [applicant] has received these amounts on her account and has used the amounts himself, probably for holidays, etc. The different amounts have never been interwoven with the common goods.

5.6.
The court considers as follows.

It is not disputed between the parties that donations were made by the parents of [the applicant]. The defendant disputes that the donations were made under an exclusion clause. Furthermore, [defendant] disputes the authenticity of her signature under the gift agreement.

The burden of proof of the authenticity of the signature rests in accordance with the usual burden of proof in Art. 150 Rv to [applicant]. She has offered proof of the authenticity of the signature no earlier than on the occasion of the oral hearing. This offer of evidence was made too late, so that the court ignored it.

The court further considers the following.

Article 2 of the grant agreement submitted by [applicant] provides that:

"The gift tax payable on this gift (...) by [the parents of [the applicant] will be paid".

On the occasion of the oral hearing it was discussed that the term “gift tax” was first introduced in the Law of December 17, 2009 amending the Inheritance Tax 1956 and some other tax laws (Stb. 2009, 564). This law entered into force on January 1, 2010. Before that date, the term “gift tax” was used. It is therefore remarkable that the gift agreement of 31 December 2002 brought into dispute by [applicant] refers to “gift tax”. When asked for oral hearing, [applicant] did not owe a statement regarding the use of the term gift tax in the agreement.

In addition, [applicant] has failed to provide any insight into the realization of the gift agreement and has failed to provide an explanation of the (build-up in the) donated amounts. In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, this had taken into account the information provided by [defendant], above in par. 5.5. comments shown, but on its way. For example, [applicant] should have explained in more detail why the contract opted for a build-up, in which initially € 100 per month is donated and after one year and eleven months € 200 per month is donated. However, she failed to do this.

The foregoing concludes that the gift contract at issue by [the applicant] cannot serve as proof of her allegation that she received gifts of exclusion from her parents during the marriage of the parties.

Finally, the Court of Appeal also considers that, even if the Court does accept a donation agreement with an exclusion clause, the [applicant's] claim to a right to compensation (that is how the Court understands her assertion that the donated amounts have always been deposited in her private account) cannot succeed. now that [the applicant] has insufficiently stated that. The single deposit to a private account does not entitle you to a fee. [applicant] should have made clear what happened to those funds subsequently (whether those funds were mixed with community funds; whether the funds were issued by the community or by her in private), but she failed to do so.

Complaint II also fails.

The loan agreement ([defendant's] complaint)

5.7.
The [defendant's] complaint means that the court wrongly crossed out the amount of € 15,000 that [applicant] transferred to her father against the amount of € 14,127.15 that [defendant] had transferred to himself from the ING savings account (ground 2.5.29). In summary, [defendant] makes the following summary.

By using a loan agreement, [applicant] has attempted to improperly safeguard funds. [applicant] has deliberately lost the funds and for that reason there is a situation as referred to in art. 1: 139 BW or art. 1: 135 BW (the court understands: Article 3: 194 BW paragraph 2).

Unlike [applicant], [defendant] was open about the amounts drawn by her. She was put on the street without any furniture and was forced to furnish a new home.

The court wrongly considered that the amounts drawn by each of the parties were virtually the same. In addition to the amounts she transferred to her father, [applicant] also included amounts to live on.

Primarily, [applicant] therefore still has to pay her an amount of € 15,000. If the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that [defendant] has wrongly drawn amounts in the amount of € 14,127.15, it owes half of that amount (€ 7,063.58) to [applicant].

In the event that the Court of Appeal deems it an appeal to Art. 1: 139 BW or art. 1: 135 does not apply, the [applicant] is still remitted with an amount of € 827.85 and must pay half of it (€ 413.93) to [defendant].

5.8.
[Applicant] has argued the following against this.

On 1 January 2017, the [defendant] 's ING account still had a balance of € 10,000 and € 12,127.13. After that date, [defendant] transferred this amount without consultation to a new account unknown to her, to keep it out of the settlement of the matrimonial community. ([Applicant] refers to Prod. 4 and 5, submitted by the defense in cross-appeal).

The rent for the new rental home of [defendant] amounted to € 750. [defendant] has purchased second-hand items to furnish the house. The value of this is in no way proportional to the amounts drawn, totaling € 22,127.13.

[defendant] now also owns half of the household effects (prod. 7).

5.9.
The court considers as follows.

It is common ground that, during the same period in which [applicant] transferred amounts to her father, [defendant] also withdrew a substantial amount from her bank account. Now that no (clear) complaints have been made against this, the court assumes the amount determined by the court of € 14,127.15. Also on appeal, [defendant] did not substantiate her assertion that she made those recordings for (the furnishing of) another house at all, which, in view of [the applicant's] reasoned dispute, would have been her way.

It therefore appears to the court that after the parties have split up, a situation has arisen in which the parties have opted to each go their own way, after which they have made withdrawals of their respective bank accounts without further consultation or mutual knowledge. It is established that both parties have their bank accounts without being open about it. In these circumstances, in which both parties have withdrawn amounts from their respective bank accounts, in the opinion of the Court of Appeal, it has proved insufficient to have a situation in which (correct) [applicant] has deliberately lost and / or hidden amounts as referred to in art.3 : 194 paragraph 2. BW. To this extent the complaint of [defendant] fails.

In view of the situation as it has arisen, the Court of Appeal considers it appropriate that [applicant] only pays [defendant] half of what it has taken in more than [defendant], therefore an amount of € 413.93. The court will thus determine. The defendant's complaint succeeds in this regard.

5 Conclusion
in the principal and the incidental appeal

6.1.
On the basis of what has been considered above, the court will partially annul the contested decision, insofar as it is subject to its judgment, and decide as set out below under 7.

6.2.
The court will compensate the costs of the appeal on appeal, now that the parties are former spouses.
