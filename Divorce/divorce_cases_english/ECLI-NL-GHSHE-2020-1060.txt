The court has set a date for judgment. The court does justice to the above-mentioned documents and the documents of the first instance.

The detailed assessment
2.1.
The court ordered a comparative judgment in the interim judgment. The competition did not lead to an amicable settlement.

2 Facts

2.2.
The following has been established between the parties.

2.2.1.
[Appellant] was married on 5 January 1995 in community of property to [the ex-wife] (hereinafter: the ex-wife).

2.2.2.
The marriage community included five properties (hereinafter: the five properties). One of the buildings was the former matrimonial home (located on the [street 1] in [place 1]) and the other four buildings (located on the [street 2] in [place 1] respectively, the [street 3 ] in [place 2], the [street 4] in [place 3] and the [street 5] in [place 2]) were investment properties intended for letting (commercial space and room rental). The ex-wife ran her business (hairdressing salon) in one of the investment properties.

2.2.3.
To finance the said buildings, [appellant] and his ex-wife took out mortgage loans with ABN Amro (concerning [street 1] and [street 2] in [place 1]) and Fortis Bank NV (regarding [ the street 3] in [place 2] and [the street 4] in [place 3]). The fifth building ([street 5] in [place 2]) is self-financed.

As security for the fulfillment of the payment obligations under the aforementioned mortgage loans, a mortgage right has also been granted to the bank on the latter property.

2.2.4.
In addition to the intended mortgage loans, [appellant] and his ex-wife had a current account credit with the bank, up to a limit of € 60,000.00 (hereinafter: the RC credit).

2.2.5.
[Appellant] and his ex-wife started living separately on August 22, 2009.

Delays have subsequently arisen in the payments on the RC credit, as a result of which the credit limit has been exceeded. In the period from December 16, 2009 to July 7, 2010, the bank urged [appellant] and his ex-wife several times to make up the deficit.

2.2.6.
In a letter dated 18 May 2010, the bank informed [appellant] of the following, following an interview on that day:

During the conversation, it was discussed, among other things, that you wish to have the current account credit of

To split proportionately € 60,000, whereby you and Ms both have a credit facility of € 30,000. We will gladly cooperate with the above arrangement.

2.2.7.
[appellant] and his ex-spouse determined in a divorce settlement of June 21, 2010 the distribution of their marriage community (hereinafter: the covenant). In summary, three properties with the associated mortgage loans were allocated to [appellant] and two properties with the associated mortgage loans to his ex-wife. In addition, the RC credit was divided in half. The distribution was conditional, namely on the condition, in short, that the bank [appellant] and his ex-wife would be released from their obligations to the bank regarding the properties not allocated to them. The parties aimed to unbundle the real estate portfolio and to split the RC credit.

2.2.8.
Fortis Bank N.V. merged with the bank on July 1, 2010. No distinction is made below between Fortis Bank N.V. and the bank.

2.2.9.
In a letter dated July 15, 2010, following an interview on July 12, 2010, the bank [appellant] announced the following:

On 12/07/2010 I spoke to you by telephone regarding your request to split the current account immediately. We have informed you that requests can only be processed once the funding requests of both parties have been approved. During the conversation, it was discussed, among other things, that there is currently a situation in your joint current account (…). Despite your situation with Ms [the ex-spouse], there is currently no possibility to release either of you from joint and several liability.

The financing requests mentioned in the quote concerned the requests of [appellant] and his ex-wife to each obtain mortgage loans for taking over the financing of the properties allocated to the property and half of the RC credit.

2.2.10.
The bank considered the financing requests to be applications for refinancing and, in that context, followed the usual assessment and approval process within the bank to examine whether the loans for [appellant] and his ex-wife were appropriate and affordable. In that context, the bank has made an inventory of the income and wealth position of both [appellant] and his ex-wife.

2.2.11.
On 16 July 2010, the bank sent an [appellant] an offer to take over the financing for the property at [the street 2] in [place 1], upon discharge of his ex-wife from joint and several liability for the existing debt. . The financing offer was subject to the condition that [appellant] would no longer be jointly and severally liable for the debts of his ex-wife.

2.2.12.
By letter of 23 July 2010, the bank claimed the RC credit from [appellant] and his ex-wife. The payment demand has not been met. By letter of 19 August 2010, the bank announced that the claim for non-compliance would be handed over for collection.

2.2.13.
On 27 August 2010, the bank sent [appellant] an offer to take over the financing for the property at [street 3] in [place 2], upon the release of his ex-wife from joint and several liability.

2.2.14.
On 14 September 2010, the bank transferred its claim under the RC credit to [collection] Incasso B.V. for collection. (hereinafter: [collection]; this company was later taken over by [Group] Group AB). At the end of September 2010, [appellant] cleared the arrears on the credit, after which [debt collection] returned the credit file to the bank.

2.2.15.
In an e-mail of 15 October 2010, the bank [appellant] communicated in a business statement a few days before following a telephone contact that the split of the RC credit was dependent on the approval of the credit department.

2.2.16.
The ex-wife's credit application was rejected in October 2010 by the bank's approvers because she had too low an income to be able to bear the charges in question independently.

2.2.17.
In late 2011, arrears again arose on both the RC credit and one of the mortgage loans ([account number]). The bank sent [appellant] and his ex-wife for the credit notices in (at least) February, May, June, July and August 2011 and for the mortgage loan in February, March, April, May and June 2011.

2.2.18.
By order of 2 March 2011, the District Court of Roermond pronounced the divorce between [appellant] and his ex-wife. The decision was entered in the registers of civil status on 10 May 2011.

2.2.19.
By letter of 13 July 2011, the bank informed [appellant] and his ex-wife that the handling of the file relating to the mortgage loan [account number] had been transferred to [collection].

2.2.20.
By e-mail of 10 August 2011, the bank gave the lawyers of [appellant] and his ex-wife 'an explanation' of the principles for an interim adjustment of the financing for [appellant] and his ex-wife. The email also reads as follows:

The aim is to have a credit agreement signed by both by August 24, so that there is more time to privately re-arrange the financing under the divorce settlement for both spouses. In total, the debt position is currently EUR 1,050,872.61, consisting of a current account and 5 medium-term loans. On August 7, there is a payment arrears of 68 days and will be transferred on August 24 and collection agency [collection] to enforce refund. As security we have a mortgage on a number of real estate with a total market value of ± EUR 1,690,000.

In order to prevent the transfer to the collection agency, we want to change the financing by suspending the current repayment obligations until further notice and reducing the financial pressure. Mr and Mrs must ensure that the interest charges are met in accordance with current conditions and that no further payment arrears arise. We would like to emphasize that no rights can be derived from the proposal and this is subject to approval by the approving body within ABN AMRO Bank. To assess affordability, we will receive the income tax return from both borrowers and an overview of the current rental income and underlying lease contracts as soon as possible. If we do not have this information in our possession on August 12, we cannot guarantee that the timelines set are sufficiently wide.

For the sake of clarity, we would like to inform you that both spouses are liable for the joint debt until further notice and that they both must also agree to the proposed refinancing.

2.2.21.
By letter of 12 August 2011, the bank informed [appellant] and his ex-wife that, under the terms of the mortgage deed, the principal of the mortgage loan [account number] was due and payable in full. The receivable, including (penalty) interest and costs, was € 178,211.69 at that time and had to be paid by 26 August 2011 at the latest.

2.2.22.
The ex-wife and her new partner were declared bankrupt by judgment of 4 October 2011 at their own request. The trustee subsequently collected the rental income from the investment property allocated to the ex-spouse under the covenant. The mortgage obligations associated with this property were not met. During the bankruptcy of the ex-spouse, no (interest) payment was made to the bank.

2.2.23.
In early October 2011, the bank transferred its receivables from both the RC credit and the mortgage loans for collection to [collection].

2.2.24.
Around the turn of the year 2011/2012, the bank decided to sell the five properties privately with the permission of the curator and [appellant]. In January 2012, the bank commissioned [makelaaerdij] Makelaardij to appraise the five properties. [makelaaerdij] Makelaardij reported on February 17, 2012.

2.2.25.
The lawyer of [appellant] informed the bank by e-mail of 26 April 2012 that [appellant] agreed to the private sale of the five properties.

2.2.26.
By e-mail of 7 May 2012, the bankruptcy trustee granted the bank a three-month period under Article 58 of the Bankruptcy Act. By e-mail of 9 May 2012, the bankruptcy trustee has given the bank permission to sell the properties privately. [makelaaerdij] Makelaardij has offered the properties for sale.

2.2.27.
By e-mail of 9 July 2012, [appellant] withdrew his permission for private sale, because in summary, in his view, the asking prices were far too low.

2.2.28.
By letter of 11 July 2012, the bank claimed all loans and the RC credit.

The total payment arrears at that time was approximately € 100,000.00.

2.2.29.
The bankruptcy trustee reported by e-mail of 24 September 2012 that [Group] immediately had to sell publicly and if not, that the bankruptcy trustee would take over the sale.

On the same day [Group] received a notice from [appellant's lawyer] that [appellant] is attempting to sell the five properties independently.

2.2.30.
The bank subsequently decided to start an execution auction.

In December 2012, a prospective buyer (Mr [the prospective buyer]) reported to the bank, who made an offer that was below both the asking price and the appraised foreclosure value. After the offer was rejected, [the prospective buyer] made a second offer.

It never came to a private sale.

2.2.31.
In December 2012, the four investment properties were sold at the public auction for € 810,000.00 to [the prospective buyer].

2.2.32.
The former marital home was sold at a public auction on January 17, 2013 for € 179,000.00. The property was resold at a later date in 2013 with a profit of € 18,500.00.

2.2.33.
After the public sales, a residual debt remained.

2.2.34.
The bankruptcy of the ex-wife was closed on October 8, 2013 for lack of benefits.

2.2.35.
By judgment of 28 February 2014, this court declared the statutory debt rescheduling scheme applicable to [appellant]. At the creditors' meeting of May 12, 2016, an agreement that [appellant] offered was adopted. The court approved the agreement on 1 June 2016, which ended the debt rescheduling scheme.

First instance

2.3.
[appellant] claimed at first instance:

I. declare that the bank has acted in breach of the law between it and

[appellant] made agreements with regard to the unbundling of the real estate;

II. declare that the bank acted wrongfully towards [appellant];

III. declare that the bank has acted in violation of its duty of care under Article 2 of the ABV;

IV. declare that the bank has acted in violation of Section 4:25 of the Wft;

V. order the bank to pay the other damage suffered by [appellant], to be made up by the state and to be settled in accordance with the law;

as well as (claims VI to VIII summarized), order to pay statutory (commercial) interest, extrajudicial costs, legal costs and follow-up costs.

In summary, [appellant] has based this on the fact that the bank has violated a duty of care towards him.

2.4.
ABN AMRO has put up a defense.

2.5.
By the contested judgment (ECLI: NL: RBLIM: 2018: 6816), the court dismissed the claims and ordered [appellant] to pay the costs of the proceedings.

3 Appeal

2.6.
[Appellant] raised fifteen complaints on appeal. It decided to set aside the contested judgment and to uphold its original claims II to VIII. In his statement of appeal, [appellant] amended his claim with regard to the original claim under I, in the sense that he now claims that the Court of Appeal shall declare:

that the bank has insufficiently taken into account the interests of [appellant] as included in the covenant known to the bank regarding the unbundling of the portfolio (vide Articles 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 of the covenant) and the division of the credit ( vide article 3.6.3).

2.7.
The bank has maintained and elaborated on its defenses from the first instance. It concluded that the contested judgment should be ratified.

4 Reasons of the Decision
2.8.
The court considers the complaints below.

Information

2.9.
According to [appellant], the procedure in this case is that the bank, in breach of its duty of care, failed to inform him in good time that she had rejected the credit application of his ex-wife. If the bank had done so, it could have taken measures that could have prevented all or part of the public sale of the real estate portfolio, in particular by agreeing on a different distribution of the properties with its ex-wife. However, the bank has deluded [appellant] that it would be fine with the credit application. [Appellant] has explicitly stated that this is the central theme in 5.38 of the statement of objections and complaint V. However, complaints II, III, IV, VI, VII and VIII also relate to this. The court discusses these complaints jointly.

2.10.
Firstly, the Court of Appeal considers that the bank had no duty of care towards [appellant] as its adviser, contrary to what [appellant] argues in the explanation to complaint III. The bank was [appellant's] counterparty to various credit agreements. The fact that [appellant] requested an amendment to the credit agreements, namely the splitting of the RC credit and the unbundling of the mortgage loans, and the bank wishing to cooperate under certain conditions, did not make the bank its adviser or contractor in other sense. Facts or circumstances that could lead to a different opinion have not been or have not been sufficiently stated or proven.

2.11.
In this case, in the opinion of the Court of Appeal, no duty of care arose for the bank to inform [appellant] about the rejection of his ex-spouse's credit application under the existing credit relationship. The Court of Appeal considers the following important for this.

2.12.
The need for refinancing arose from the divorce between [appellant] and his ex-wife and the way in which they had divided the matrimonial community by covenant. [Appellant] knew that the refinancing depended on whether he and his ex-wife could have their own separate financing. This was already contained in the covenant and the bank has repeatedly brought this to the attention of [appellant]. What has been put forward does not provide good grounds for assuming that [appellant] could presume that such financing would be granted. But there is even less reason to believe that the bank understood and should reasonably understand that [appellant] assumed this. From the reports that the bank [appellant] sent after the conclusion of the covenant, it must have been clear to [appellant] that his ex-wife did not meet her payment obligations to the bank, that arrears were incurred and debt collection measures were being prepared. Under these circumstances, the bank did not need to understand that [appellant] was nevertheless under the delusion that a credit application by his wife had been or would be approved. At no time during that period did the bank also inform [appellant] that the credit would be extended to its ex-wife.

The bank's email of August 10, 2011 (see 2.2.20) confirms that there was no credit commitment at the time. The bank therefore had no reason or obligation to point out again to [appellant] that there was no credit commitment to his ex-wife.

2.13.
In addition, [appellant] was able and required from the email of the bank of 10 August 2011 not only that the bank needed documents, but that these documents were also needed to assess the 'affordability' of the 'restructuring'. by the 'approving body' within the bank. [Appellant] subsequently received no notification from the bank that approval of the recalculation had been or would be granted. There are no facts or circumstances on the basis of which the bank had to take into account that [appellant] trusted after 10 August 2011 that the approval had been granted, or that the approval would be granted outright. His ex-wife was subsequently declared bankrupt within two months, which meant that the intended refinancing was completely over.

2.14.
It follows from the foregoing that grievances III to VIII fail. The court can therefore leave open whether or not what the bank has argued with reference to conversation reports, namely that it was once or several times in conversations with [appellant] that the credit application of his ex-wife was rejected.

2.15.
Insofar as [appellant] has wanted to argue that the bank should have informed him that his ex-wife had applied for a higher credit than was necessary for the mere taking over of the financing of the properties allocated to her, [appellant] denies that it was not free for the bank to share such details of the application with it. Nor does it lead to any other outcome. In view of the circumstances set out above, the bank had no reason to believe that [appellant] assumed that his ex-wife had or would receive a credit commitment, and therefore no reason to point out to him that a loan application, for any amount was rejected.

2.16.
As an extension of this, complaint I cannot lead to the annulment of the contested judgment. The complaint concerns the determination by the court that the documents requested by the bank by email of 10 August 2011 have not been provided. Even if [appellant] and his ex-wife provided the documents, the bank could not reasonably have assumed that [appellant] was wrongly assuming that his ex-wife was or would be granted the necessary credit. Incidentally, [appellant] did not claim that his ex-wife provided the requested documents.

2.17.
Nor can complaint II result in the annulment of the contested judgment.

[appellant] considers the alleged failure of the bank to inform him in time about the rejection of his ex-wife's credit application as a violation of Section 4:25 of the Financial Supervision Act (Wft) and calls for a declaration of law. Even if the bank has not violated its duty of care as a result of the alleged failure to act, the court cannot issue the requested statement of law.

Valuation [brokerage] Brokerage

2.18.
Complaint IX concerns the valuation of the properties that [makelaaerdij] Makelaardij has carried out on behalf of the bank. According to [appellant], [makelaaerdij] Makelaardij has valued the properties far too low. Because [makelaaerdij] Makelaardij subsequently offered the properties for sale at too low an asking price, it was no longer possible to ask a higher price afterwards, according to [appellant]. He holds the bank liable for the disadvantage that [appellant] has suffered as a result of this, because [makelaaerdij] Makelaardij acted as the bank's assistant on this point.

2.19.
The complaint was brought in vain. Even if another broker has valued the value of the properties higher, this does not mean that [makelaaerdij] Makelaardij has not determined the value as a reasonably acting and reasonably competent appraiser. [Appellant] has not provided any concrete facts or circumstances that show that this is the case. Moreover, it is not plausible that [makelaaerdij] Makelaardij has valued the value too low. After all, even for the asking price that was too low according to [appellant], no one bought the properties privately.

[the prospective buyer]

2.20.
With complaint X, [appellant] argues that the bank did not seriously consider the private offer of [the prospective buyer], with the result that [the prospective buyer] later acquired the investment properties for a much lower amount at the auction. According to [appellant], the bank did not want to comply with an entirely reasonable request from [the prospective buyer]. According to his claims at first instance, this request relates to the provision of financing to [the prospective buyer] for the purchase of the properties.

2.21.
The basic principle is that the bank is free to determine to whom it wishes to grant credit. Leaving aside whether [the prospective buyer] indeed did not purchase the investment properties privately because of the refusal of financing by the bank, [appellant] has not put forward any facts or circumstances that justify the conclusion that the bank was obliged to [the prospective buyer]. to grant a credit. The complaint therefore fails.

Account managers

2.22.
In the explanatory note to complaint XI, [appellant] claims that his file has been handled by various account managers, apparently without a proper transfer taking place. According to him, the question is whether the account managers have understood what was going on. Complaint XII also relates to this.

2.23.
What [appellant] states in this regard does not constitute a shortcoming on the part of the bank in fulfilling its obligations under the credit agreements or otherwise towards [appellant]. It was up to the bank to determine who handled [appellant's] file. In view of the explanations given by the bank and the notes that were included in the file, there is also no reason to assume that the treatment providers did not understand what was going on. Nor did [appellant] put forward any arguments that could show that the bank made detrimental decisions for [appellant] because information was not taken into account that should have been known within the bank. The complaints XI and XII are therefore ineffective.

Debt restructuring

2.24.
According to the explanatory note to complaint XIII, after the public sale of the properties, the bank declared the residual debt, which was much higher than the actual residual debt. According to [appellant], the residual debt was not € 189,501.30, but € 19,895.98, which amount he could have paid with the help of friends and acquaintances, so that he would not have had to resort to the statutory debt rescheduling scheme.

2.25.
The court first states that [appellant] has been released from his debt to the bank by the termination of the debt rescheduling scheme. He has not explained what financial disadvantage he suffered as a result of the bank's allegedly incorrect statement. Moreover, the statement or statements referred to by [appellant] according to his statements at first instance were made after [appellant] was admitted to the debt rescheduling scheme. The claim of [appellant] that the statement or statements prompted him to appeal to the debt rescheduling scheme is therefore incomprehensible, so that the Court of Appeal passes it. For the rest, [appellant] has not explained why the residual debt was not € 189,501.30, but € 19,895.98. Taking into account what the court considered about this in 4.16 of the contested judgment, this did have its way. [Appellant] has therefore insufficiently explained his statements on this point. Complaint XIII also fails.

Other grievances

2.26.
Complaint XIV has no independent meaning. The court therefore does not need to discuss the complaint.

2.27.
Complaint XV concerns the legal costs. This complaint fails. [appellant] should bear the costs of the proceedings of the first instance, because he has been rightly unsuccessful.

Proof

2.28.
[appellant] has offered evidence on several points. However, the court will not allow him to provide evidence, because no facts or circumstances have been presented that could lead to a different decision.

5 Conclusion

2.29.
The conclusion is that the complaints cannot lead to the annulment of the contested judgment. The court will therefore confirm the verdict.

2.30.
[appellant] has been unsuccessful. The costs of the appeal are therefore at his expense. When determining the salary of the banker's lawyer, the court applies rate VI. Although the receivables do not contain any concrete amounts, the claims of [appellant] show that the monetary value is higher than € 195,000.00. After all, the damage caused by the allegedly incorrect appraisal by [makelaaerdij] Makelaardij has budgeted [appellant] at € 190,000.00 (see reply in reply under 9.4).

To date, the court has determined the legal costs on the bank's side as follows:

- court registry fee € 726.00

- lawyer's salary € 3,919.00

total € 4,645.00

6 Decision
The Council:

3.1.
ratifies the contested judgment;

3.2.
orders, [appellant] in the costs of the proceedings, enforceable on inventory, to date determined on the part of the bank at € 4,645.00.

This judgment was given by mrs. W.J.J. Los, L.S. Frakes and R.W. Karskens and spoken publicly by the role councilor on March 24, 2020.
