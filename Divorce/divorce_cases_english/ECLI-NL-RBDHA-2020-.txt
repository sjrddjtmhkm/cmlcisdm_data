3 Reasons of the Decision
Pursuant to Article 1: 250 of the Dutch Civil Code (BW), the court may appoint a special receiver. In view of the nature of the case and the conflicts of interest involved, the court deems it necessary in the interests of [primary minor] to appoint a special receiver.

The court requests the special receiver to answer the following questions:

What does the [first name minor] indicate about a possible stay in Italy and a possible stay in the Netherlands?

To what extent does [first name minor] appear to express himself freely?

To what extent does [first name minor] seem to have an overview of the consequences of a stay in Italy or a stay in the Netherlands?

Does [first name minor] want to speak to the judge (s) and if so, does [first name minor] want the special curator to be present?

Have any details emerged that are important for the decisions to be taken?

The special receiver is expected to have an interview with [first name minor] to gain insight into the opinion of [first name minor] with regard to the stay in Italy and the stay in the Netherlands and subsequently that opinion of [first name minor] to bring forward in this procedure. It is expressly not the intention of the court that the special guardian will involve parents in this. It only concerns conversations with [first name minor].

The parents are expected to fully cooperate with the planning and execution of the conversations of [first name minor] with the special curator.

The special receiver must send a written report to the court and the parents at the latest two days before the treatment to be determined at the hearing. If necessary, the special receiver will explain the report at the hearing.

Reference to the Multiple Chamber

The court has taken note of what the parties have argued with regard to the exclusive jurisdiction of this court in return proceedings, more explicitly the jurisdiction of this court in the present case, now that the father is a lawyer who regularly pleads with this court.

The mother has referred to the court's opinion with regard to the jurisdiction of this court. By letter of 28 January 2020, the father requested that a decision be taken on this point that would not delay the decision in the present proceedings.

In view of the matters discussed at the hearing and what the parties have put forward in writing after the hearing, the court refers the case to a multiple chamber of this court for further substantive treatment.
