The oral hearing took place on February 4, 2020. Parties have appeared, assisted by their lawyers.

2 Facts
3.1
The parties' marriage was dissolved on August 4, 2011 by divorce.

3.2
In the (divorce) order of 13 July 2011, the court determined that the man will pay € 431 per month as a living allowance as of the date of registration of the divorce decision in the registers of civil status. As of 1 January 2019, this contribution amounts to € 483.57 per month after indexation.

3 Scope of Dispute
4.1
In the contested order, the court declared the man inadmissible in his request for the zero payment of the living expenses of the woman to be paid by him (hereinafter also: spousal maintenance). The court has compensated the legal costs in the sense that everyone bears his own costs.

4.2
The man appealed against the contested decision with one complaint. The man has changed his request for the oral hearing. He requests the court - with immediate effect - to annul the contested decision and, having recourse, the spousal maintenance to be paid by him to the woman with effect from

January 1, 2019 to be set at € 396 per month and as of June 25, 2019 at nil.

4.3
The woman defends. She requests the court, as far as practicable with stock, to declare the man primarily inadmissible in his request for nullification or change of the determined partner maintenance, alternatively as an independent request, if the court finds that there are changed circumstances. the woman to set the rejection of the request of the husband and the partner maintenance as of November 26, 2018 amended at € 1,115.12 gross per month, to be paid monthly in advance by the husband, costs in law.

4 Reasons of the Decision
5.1
Pursuant to Section 1: 401 of the Dutch Civil Code (BW), a court ruling regarding spousal maintenance can (only) be amended by court decision, insofar as it is relevant here, if this decision ceases to meet the legal standards due to a change in circumstances.

The man argues that the court wrongly declared him inadmissible in his request because there is no question of a change in circumstances as referred to in Section 1: 401 of the Dutch Civil Code. According to the man, in 2011, contrary to what is stated in the contested decision, the court did not decide on the amount of the partner's maintenance from June 25, 2019, the date on which the payment of his annuity policy would stop. The man had his annuity policy paid out in full in September 2013. The man no longer disputes on appeal that this payment should suddenly remain at his expense and risk, since the court in 2011 assumed a monthly payment of the annuity policy up to and including 24 in determining the amount of partner maintenance. June 2019. The man is of the opinion that - in short - at least as of June 25, 2019 there are changed circumstances within the meaning of Article 1: 401 BW, because he would have relapsed as of that date even without the surrender in 2013. on his AOW pension. Unlike the District Court, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that the expiry of the (by the surrender in 2013) date of the expiry of the annuity policy, 25 June 2019, is a relevant change of circumstances that requires a reassessment of the need and justifies the carrying capacity. To that extent the man's complaint succeeds.

5.2
The court will reject the amended request of the husband to the oral hearing from 1 January 2019 to 25 June 2019 to set the spousal maintenance to be paid by him to the woman at € 396 per month due to lack of capacity. The man's standing is only eligible for an assessment if the man makes it plausible that there is also a relevant change in circumstances during that period. It is not enough to just mention a lack of capacity as a reason for a change in the maintenance obligation.

5.3
The court will reject the (independent) request from the woman to set the spousal maintenance to be paid by the husband to her as of 26 November 2018 at € 1,115.12. The mere statement that the woman's requirement in 2010 of € 985 gross per month after indexation in 2019 is € 1,115.12 gross per month is not sufficient for this. Certainly now that the court did not (re) determine the need of the woman in 2011, the woman could be expected to have further substantiated her position.

5.4
The statement of the man on the oral hearing that the woman no longer needs a contribution from him, because her need would have faded, the court does not consider now that this statement, based on the so-called two-conclusion doctrine, already applies to the petition should have been brought forward. The same applies to the man's assertion that the woman herself can meet her needs because she would have had an inheritance from her recently deceased son.

5.5
The court assumes that the woman's needs are at least the € 431 per month determined by the court in 2011. That is indexed to 2019 € 483.57 per month.

5.6
The man, born on [date of birth] 1943, lives with / is married to [A]. From June 26, 2019 to December 31, 2019, he received an AOW benefit of € 889 per month gross including holiday allowance.

5.7
The man also runs a business in the form of a sole proprietorship, a tree-technical consultancy, called [name of a sole proprietorship]. The annual accounts of this company from the past three years show the following figures (in euros):

2017 2018 2019

Turnover 2,330 2,210 2,840

Operating expenses 980 1,676 1,956

Shareholders' equity - / - 542 - / - 546 - / - 504

Operating result 751 1,125 91

The man is entitled to the SME profit exemption, the employed person's tax credit and the elderly person's tax credit.

5.8
The court calculated the man's net disposable income and his ability to pay. A certified copy of this calculation is attached and forms part of this Decision. The court refers to that calculation and only discusses below the items on which the parties disagree.

5.9
The court takes into account the average of the profit from the man's business for the years 2017 to 2019 of € 492. The woman states that the man has had considerably fatter years with his company in previous years. According to her, the man did not make enough reservations in those years. The woman thinks it cannot be passed on to her that the man has lived too lavishly.

The court is of the opinion that by assuming an average profit over the past three years, sufficient account has been taken of fluctuations in the results of the man's company. Moreover, given the man's advanced age (76 years), it is not to be expected that the profits from his company will increase (significantly) in the coming years.

5.10
The court does not take into account the compulsory deductible of the health insurance, since the husband has not made plausible that he pays this deductible against the reasoned dispute of the woman.

5.11
From the attached calculation, it follows that as of June 25, 2019, the man has no capacity to pay spousal maintenance to the woman.

5.12
The Court of Appeal is of the opinion that June 25, 2019, the date on which payment of the annuity policy would normally have ended, should be used as the commencement date. Now that the husband and the woman have confirmed at the oral hearing that the husband has a (very) large backlog in the payment of the partner maintenance owed by him to the woman in recent years, the determination of this commencement date does not lead to a repayment obligation of the woman to the man.

6 The conclusion
6.1
On the basis of what has been considered above, the man's complaint partially succeeds. The woman's independent appeal will be rejected. The court will annul the contested decision and decide as will be stated below.

6.2
The court will compensate the legal costs in both instances, now that the parties are former husbands and the proceedings concern the woman's living expenses.

5 Decision
The appellate court, on appeal:

quashes the order of the court of Gelderland, seat Zutphen, of 5 June 2019, and again having:

amends the decision of the court of Almelo of 13 July 2011 and sets the contribution to be paid by the man to the woman in the cost of living as of 25 June 2019 at nil;

declares this decision enforceable to the extent that it is in stock;

compensates the costs of the proceedings in both instances, in that each party is to bear its own costs;

rejects the more or otherwise requested.

This decision was made by mrs. M.H.F. van Vugt, A. Smeeïng-van Hees enL. Hamer, assisted by mr. J.M. van Gastel-Goudswaard as Registrar, and was pronounced in public in the presence of the Registrar on March 3, 2020.
