2.5.
Separation

3 Appeal
2.5.1.
Parties request that the divorce be pronounced between them. They argue that marriage has been permanently disrupted.

2.5.2.
Pursuant to Article 815 (2) DCCP, insofar as it is relevant here, a (preliminary) petition for divorce must contain a parental plan with regard to the minor children of parties over whom they jointly exercise authority. Because the parental plan is formulated in law as a procedural requirement for a divorce petition, the court has the power to declare a spouse in the divorce petition inadmissible unless there are reasons to believe that the parental plan cannot reasonably be submitted (Article 815 paragraph 6 DCCP).

2.5.3.
No parental plan has been submitted by the parties in accordance with Article 815 (2) DCCP. Because the parties have given sufficient reasons that it is not reasonably possible for them to present a parental plan that has been agreed by both parties, the court will receive the parties in their request for divorce.

2.5.4.
The divorce petition is granted if not disputed and based on the law.

2.6.
Supervision

2.7.
During the oral hearing, the man argued that [first name minor] should be placed under supervision. The woman agrees. The Council shares this view and therefore requests that during the oral hearing [minor minor] be supervised for a period of twelve months. The court endorses the concerns, partly in view of the submitted notification form Protection Table Youth South Holland South of January 23, 2020, and will grant the request.

2.8.
Residence

2.8.1.
The man requests that the primary residence of [first name of young adult] and [first name of minor] be with him.

2.8.2.
The woman refers to the judgment of the court.

4 Reasons of the Decision
2.8.3.
The court will determine the primary residence of [first name minor] with the man, because this request has not been contested and is based on the law. It has not been shown that the interests of [first name minor] oppose this. The request to determine the primary residence of [major young adult] in the man is rejected because he reached the age of eighteen on 2 January 2020.

2.9.
Care plan

2.9.1.
The woman requests that the distribution of care and upbringing duties (hereinafter: care regulation) be established as follows:

[First name of major adult] and [First name of minor] stay with the woman in the odd weeks from Friday afternoon 4 p.m. to Saturday afternoon 5.30 p.m.

the parties will agree upon the pick-up and return arrangement, whereby the parent with whom [first name of the young adult] and [first name of the minor] reside takes them back to the other parent;

public holidays and school holidays are shared equally by mutual agreement between the parties;

if one of the parents is unable to take care of [first name of young adult] and [first name of minor] then the minors will stay with the other parent.

2.9.2.
The man defends. He argues that it is in the interest of [first name minor] to have contact with the woman under the supervision of an expert, given the length of time that [first name minor] and the woman have not seen each other and the resistance of [first name minor ] against contact with the woman.

2.9.3.
After discussing the woman's request during the oral hearing, the parties agree that the woman, under the supervision of an expert (the youth protector or an employee of the GI), has contact with [first name minor]. In this way, the contact between the woman and [first name minor] can be built up under supervision. The court will decide accordingly.

The request to determine a care scheme with [first name, young adult] is rejected because he reached the age of eighteen on 2 January 2020.

2.10.
Information and consultation scheme

2.10.1.
The parties have agreed on an information arrangement whereby the man sends the woman by email three recent and closely resembling color photos of [first name minor] and informs her about experiences and developments that [first name minor] is experiencing.

This can be about fun experiences that he experiences with friends and / or in the home situation or about developments that he goes through (for example, about the daily course of events, school, hobbies, etc.), but also information about less pleasant experiences and developments. .

2.11.
Continued use of the house and tenancy law

2.11.1.
The man requests the continued use of the house for a period of six months and the tenancy law of the house.

2.11.2.
The woman refers to the judgment of the court.

2.11.3.
The court will grant the husband's request with regard to the tenancy law of a matrimonial home as of the date of this order, because this request has not been disputed and is based on the law.

The request regarding the continued use of the house is rejected, because the man has no interest in this request.

2.12.
Distribution

2.12.1.
Parties are married in general community of property.

2.12.2.
The parties request each to determine the manner of distribution of the community of goods existing between the parties in the manner proposed by him / her.

2.12.3.
In order to order or determine the method of distribution, it is required that the parties provide the judge with the information that is necessary to determine both the size and the composition of the community to be divided on the reference date.

2.12.4.
The court is of the opinion that it is not possible to determine the distribution, as requested by each of the parties, or to order the method of distribution.

Even if the court were to make a decision on whether the car (Chrysler PT Cruiser 2.0.) And which model trains belong to the community, the parties do not state and substantiate sufficiently to be able to determine [brand name] for the household goods of the brand. what the size of this is on the reference date. In addition, it cannot be determined whether the community is indebted to Ms [name] and, if so, what the internal obligation to contribute should in that case be. The parties are also litigating separately about external liability. It is also not possible to determine whether the community belongs to a debt to the Tax Authorities, from the man claims about â‚¬ 50,000. For no good reason, the man only asserts the existence of this debt during (the second part of) the oral hearing. In view of the dispute by the woman, the existence of the alleged tax liability has not been established on the one hand, while, on the other hand, it is not implausible that they have a tax debt in view of the parties' other claims regarding their financial management.

2.12.5.
The principle that no one can be compelled to remain in an undivided estate does not mean that the judge is under all circumstances obliged to order or determine the method of distribution. Since the parties have not fully complied with their obligation to compose and the court does not have the necessary information to order or determine the manner of distribution, the reciprocal requests of the parties will be rejected.

2.13.
Litigation costs

2.13.1.
Given the nature of the proceedings, the court will determine that each of the parties bears its own costs.
