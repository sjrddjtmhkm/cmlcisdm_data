1 Proceedings
1.1.
For the submissions and requests made at first instance, the proceedings there and for the considerations and decisions of the Court of First Instance of Curaçao (GEA), reference is made to 7 July 2016, 13 February 2017, 21 August 2017 and 24 August. 2018 interim decisions, the last of which is a partial decision. The content of those decisions applies as inserted here.

1.2. [
[Appellant] et al. appealed against the aforementioned partial decision by appeal of 5 October 2018, with exhibits. In it, it explained the appeal and concluded that the Court of Justice will set aside the order and, once again, will grant the 'ordinary division' of Tucacas requested in first instance by halves and allocation of those halves, as requested, as yet.

1.3.
On 29 May 2019, mr. Davelaar submitted productions on behalf of [interested party, sub 1] et al.

1.4.
An oral hearing took place on 4 June 2019. Mr Peterson, [interested party 1], accompanied by mr. Davelaar and Christel Monsanto, experienced in archival research, mr. Diaz, mr. Van Rossum and drs. Jonker, as well as stakeholders. [Interested party 1] submitted documents at the hearing.

1.5.
As agreed at the hearing, on July 4, 2019, Mr. Davelaar took a deed after plea, with productions, on behalf of [interested party sub 1] et al.

1.6.
This deed was intended to be published on the Court's website on 4 July 2019, but this was not done by mistake. A response from stakeholders on August 20, 2019 has therefore not materialized. The deed is currently on the website.

1.7.
Decision has been made to date.

2 Appeal
For the grounds of the appeal, please refer to the notice of appeal.

3 Reasons of the Decision
3.1.
One of the judges before the oral hearing of 4 June 2019 has returned to the Netherlands. The Court will therefore continue the oral procedure. In the following, preliminary judgments will be given that may be discussed in the continuation of the oral hearing.

3.2.
In the contested partial decision, the GEA rejected the request from [appellant] and others, who is descended from Maria Martha's granddaughter Maria Andrea Martina (stake A), to divide Tucacas in half and to divide half of him in order to have half distributed among the participants of stake A.

3.3.
The GEA considered:

2.5
In the opinion of the Court of First Instance, this case does not lend itself to an ordinary distribution, nor to a partial distribution as referred to in art. 3: 200a paragraph 3 BW. As emphasized by the clients of Mr. Meulen in their petition, some of them have litigated since 2002 to reach a division. In a final judgment of 3 October 2011 (case number AR 47142, formerly 2002/334), it was stated between “[appellant sub 1] et al.” and [interested party sub 3] and Erven [name 1] ”the defendants have been convicted with plaintiffs to separate and share the estate (s) of [child 1] Martina (Faneyte) and of Maria Martha, with appointment of a notary and a neuter person to represent heirs whose existence is uncertain or who are absent, unreachable or refusal. The clients of mr. Meulen and the appointed civil-law notary have not been able to reach a distribution with that judgment. It is not clear that this would be the case with a new, comparable decision. In addition, it is not plausible that all partners within family A, so to speak the own family of the clients of mr. Meulen, can be traced. In the first place, twenty members of family A are missing in this case. These are the persons whose names are highlighted in yellow in the family tree above. Furthermore, no evidence has been found or is being conducted into matrimonial property regimes, divorces and wills. Notarial certificates of inheritance are missing. In this state of affairs, a (partial) ordinary distribution, with or without the appointment of a neutral person, is not possible.

3.4.
The appeal of [appellant] et al. Is directed against this rejection.

3.5.
The GEA is based on a pedigree shown in the contested decision under 2.1. In this family tree the original owner Maria Martha (January 19, 1814 - March 23, 1903) has one child, namely [child 1] Martina, also known as [child 1] Faneyte (June 15, 1841 - May 29, 1914), and has child two children, namely Maria Andrea Martina (November 30, 1870 - February 3, 1945), from whom [appellant] cs is descended, and Francisco Martes Martina (March 7, 1884 - January 3, 1935).

3.6.
If this premise persists, the appeal will succeed. The stake of [appellant] et al. (Stake A in the contested decision) is then entitled to half of Tucacas. Tucacas is large 91,770 m2. Assuming a price of approximately NAf 30 per m2, the value could be approximately NAf 2,753,100. The number of participants according to the family tree included in the contested decision is not so great that it can be said that "the value of the shares of the participants is very small" (Article 3: 200a paragraph 1 of the Dutch Civil Code). Furthermore, the vast majority of partners have been identified. For those who have not been tracked down - the GEA names twenty - a neutral person can be appointed to represent them (Article 3: 181 BW). This neutral person can settle for a reserved amount (a certain percentage of the proceeds: [appellant] et al. Apparently wants to sell to a project developer). The neuter person may also agree that the claim of the absent party expires in five years, after which what is left of the reserved amount can still be divided. The judge can also make this arrangement. The fact that some sorting out is still needed (possible prenuptial agreements, divorces and wills, which incidentally did not occur often among those involved) does not prevent a regular division. In the past, a regular division was indeed unsuccessful, but at the time stake B was involved, which is less clear. Moreover, apparently no neutral person was engaged at the time and the limitation construction outlined above was not considered.

3.7. [
[interested party 1] et al. disputes the principle that Maria Martha had only one child and [child 1] Martina (also: [child 1] Faneyte) only two children. If it is the same with [interested party 1] et al., Then depending on the number of other children, the way of article 3: 200a et seq. Of the Dutch Civil Code (communities that have not been divided for a long time) is open and the contested decision must be confirmed.

Did Maria Martha have more than one child?

3.8.
Based on the documents submitted by [interested party 1] et al. Below, the Court considers it plausible that Maria Martha had six children: [child 1] Martina ([child 1] Faneyte), [child 2] Denisia ([child 2 ] Denisia Pedro), [child 3] Antonio ([child 3] Antonio Beker), [child 4] Elisa ([child 4] Elizabeth Beker), [child 5] Nicolaas ([child 5] Nicolaas Karel) and [child 6 Vincent.

3.9.
The Court has noticed that the documents contain inaccuracies, including variations in spelling, and that names of persons have also changed (see statement of the head of registry office / population register of 1 February 2007, production 154 dated 29 May 2019). The name of Maria Martha's mother is Juana Justina and also Johanna Augustina and Guana Augustina. The second husband of Maria Martha is called: [name 3] Carlo and also [name 3] Pedro, [name 3] Beker, [name 3] Pedro Beker and [name 3] Karel. Her (first) daughter is called: [child 1] Martina and also Ercilia Martina, Orselia Martina, [child 1] Faneyte, [child 1] Van Eyken and [child 1] van Eyker. At that time, no population register existed, nor were identity documents in use.

3.10.
The Court's findings are confirmed by the statement of Christel Monsanto, experienced in archival research, (exhibit 167 of July 4, 2019).

3.11.
The documents submitted by [interested party item 1] are the following:

a. Production 13 of December 27, 2016: Maria Martha was born on January 19, 1814.

b. Exhibit 156 of May 29, 2019, at the session of June 4, 2019, a clearer copy was submitted (draft transcript as exhibit 158 ​​dated July 4, 2019): Maria Martha, 25 years (considering the date of birth under a, she should be 26; Hof), no profession, daughter of Juana Justina, no profession, married on 29 July 1840 to Johannes Clement, 36 years old, fisherman.

c. Her daughter [child 1] Martina (also known as [child 1] Faneyte) was born on June 15, 1841 (see the statement of the head of registry office / population register of February 1, 2007, production 154 dated May 29, 2019).

d. Her husband Johannes Clemens apparently died (see below under e).

e. Production 157 of May 29, 2019, at the session of June 4, 2019, a clearer copy was submitted (draft transcription as production 159 dated July 4, 2019): on October 10, 1849, Maria Martha, widow of Johannes Clement, straw hat maker, daughter of Johanna Augustina , no profession, with [name 3] Carlo, 21 years old, shoemaker;

f. Production 18 of December 27, 2016 (birth and death certificate): on April 18, 1850 was born [child 2] Denisia ([child 2] Denisia Pedro) from the marriage of [name 3] Pedro and Maria Martha. According to Christel Monsanto, her son has reported the death of his grandmother Maria Martha (see below under k);

g. Exhibit 19 of December 27, 2016, at the session of June 4, 2019, a clearer copy was provided (birth and death certificate): on September 13, 1851 (1851 without day and month ??) was born [child 3] Antonio ([child 3] Antonio Beker) from the marriage of [name 3] Pedro ([name 3] Beker) and Maria Martha;

h. Production 20 of December 27, 2016, at the session of June 4, 2019, a clearer copy was submitted (birth and death certificate): on June 13, 1854 (June 16, 1854 ??) was born [child 4] Elisa ([child 4] Elizabeth Beker ) from the marriage of [name 3] Calvo ([name 3] Pedro Beker) and Maria Martha;

i. Production 21 of December 27, 2016, at the session of June 4, 2019, a clearer copy was provided (birth and death certificate): on August 19, 1857 (August 9, 1857 yes), [child 5] Nicolaas ([child 5] Nicolaas Karel) was born from the marriage of [name 3] Karel and Maria Martha;

j. Production 22 of December 27, 2016, at the session of June 4, 2019, a clearer copy was provided (birth certificate): on September 2, 1860 (August 9, 1857 ??) was born [child 6] Vincent from the marriage of [name 3] Karel and Maria Martha.

k. Production 14 of December 27, 2016: Maria Martha, daughter of Guana Augustina, died on March 23, 1903. According to Christel Monsanto (production 167 of July 4, 2019 at the end), her grandson [name 4] Floris (Martes), son of her daughter [child 2] Denisia Pedro (see above under f), gave up her death. However, production 14 of December 27, 2016 is partially illegible; see further below rov. 3.20.

3.12.
With this, the appeal of [appellant] et al. Fails because, with the existence of six children of Maria Martha, the share of the participants in the branch of Maria Martha's granddaughter Maria Andrea Martina has become "very small". The Court will also examine the second issue.

Did [child 1] Martina (also: [child 1] Faneyte) have more than two children?

3.13. [
[child 1] Martina ([child 1] Faneyte), was born unmarried.

3.14.
From productions 161-166 of July 4, 2019 it appears that she had (at least) six children:

- Dionisia Orelia Martina (production 161, born October 9, 1863),

- Johannes Silverius Martina (production 162, born August 26, 1865),

- Poulina Ermita Martina (production 163, born January 11, 1868),

- Maria Andrea Martina (production 164, born November 30, 1870),

- Poulina Martilia Martina (production 165, born September 23, 1875) and

- Francisco Martes Martina (production 166, born March 7, 1884).

3.15.
In the contested decision, the GEA took into account only two children, namely Maria Andrea Martina (Exhibit 164) and Francisco Martes Martina (Exhibit 166).

3.16.
According to the statement of the head of registry office / population register of February 1, 2007, under B (production 154 dated May 29, 2019), [child 1] Martina has another child ([name 5] Marcelio Martina, born January 15, 1879).

Outcome

3.17.
Since it is likely that the original owner of Tucacas, Maria Martha, had six children (and not one, as in the contested partial decision) and one of her daughters [child 1] Martina ([child 1] Faneyte) had six or seven children (and not two, as in the contested partial decision), the share of [appellant] et al. - who is descended from one of the children of [child 1] Martina ([child 1] Faneyte) - is very small. The GEA rightly ruled that all Tucacas must be settled with the application of Article 3: 200 a ff of the Dutch Civil Code, without there being grounds for the application of Article 200a (3) of the Dutch Civil Code.

3.18.
In the preliminary view of the Court, the contested partial decision must be confirmed.

3.19.
Due to the large number of interested parties without the possibility of postponement, the Court will determine a time for the oral procedure to be continued. The preliminary judgments of the Court given above can be discussed there. Interested parties are free to submit documents before the hearing.

3.20.
The Court wishes to receive evidence from [interested party 1] et al. (Or others) of the assertion of Christel Monsanto (production 167 of 4 July 2019 at the end) that the grandson of Maria Martha, namely [name 4] Floris (Martes) , son of her daughter [child 2] Denisia Pedro, reported the death of Maria Martha in 1903 (see legal ground 3.11 under f and k above). Production 14 of December 27, 2016 is partially illegible. If the statement of Christel Monsanto is correct, this would be an additional indication of the correctness of what the Court has provisionally assumed as correct, namely that Maria Martha did not have [child 1] Martina (Faneyte) as the only child.

3.21.
Any further decision is reserved.
