1 Proceedings

The claimant brought an appeal against the defendant's decision of 3 October 2019 (the contested decision).

The defendant has lodged a statement of defense.

The appeal was heard on 17 January 2020, together with the cases AWB 19/8007 and AWB 19/8008. Plaintiff and defendant have been represented by their authorized representatives. Also present was [name 2] (sponsor).

2 Facts
1. Plaintiff was born on [date of birth] and has Syrian nationality. Plaintiff's mother (sponsor) received an asylum residence permit on 26 September 2017. On 13 March 2018, the sponsor submitted an application on behalf of the claimant for the granting of a provisional residence permit (MVV) in the context of a subsequent trip. The defendant rejected this application by decision of 30 March 2018 (the primary decision). Plaintiff has objected to this.

2. On 25 March 2019, respondent heard referent. In the contested decision, the respondent subsequently declared the objection unfounded. At the time of the application, the claimant was 28 years old, so that he does not fall under the so-called young adult policy. In view of paragraph C2 / 4.1 of the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines 2000 (Vc), this means that there must be a more than usual dependency relationship between claimant and sponsor. According to the respondent, this is not the case. During the hearing, the sponsor stated that the plaintiff is not financially dependent on her. Plaintiff also does not need a sponsor for daily care. He has shelter, food, clothing and is in good health. Finally, no form of more than usual dependence has been found. In addition, the defendant also pointed out that there is no valid background statement signed by the plaintiff.

3 Appeal
3. In appeal, the plaintiff first argued that the hearing with the sponsor was very sloppy. The claimant's agent also lodged a complaint about this. The referee was unable to give a clear answer to the questions asked and this was not taken into account sufficiently. The content of the report of the hearing is therefore wrongly used against the claimant. Furthermore, the defendant wrongly failed to provide further reasons why the plaintiff is not covered by the young adult policy. Plaintiff refers to a judgment of this court, seat Utrecht, of September 18, 2019. Plaintiff further states, referring to jurisprudence of the ECtHR, that it is still questionable whether an age limit of 25 years can be called reasonable. The court judge as follows.

4 Reasons of the Decision
4. The court finds that the representative of the plaintiff expressed her dissatisfaction with the conduct of the hearing by letter of 26 March 2019. The file also contains a telephone note dated 8 April 2019, which shows that the respondent has spoken to the authorized representative about the course of the hearing. Respondent has indicated that all parties have indicated that the session did not go entirely as desired, because it proved difficult to apply structure. The agent did not contribute to this either, according to the respondent. This will be included in the internal evaluation. According to the telephone note, the authorized representative was satisfied with the handling of her complaint after the conversation.

5. The court further finds that the report of the hearing indeed shows that the referee regularly had difficulty in properly understanding and answering the questions. However, the court also finds that this has been sufficiently taken into account and that the authorized representative also had sufficient opportunity during the hearing to supplement this where necessary. The respondent was therefore allowed to include the statements of the sponsor, as shown in the report of the hearing, in the decision-making. The grounds for appeal fail.

6. It follows from the defendant's subsequent travel policy, laid down in paragraph C2 / 4.1 of the Vc that the defendant grants a residence permit asylum on the basis of Article 29, second paragraph, of the Aliens Act 2000 (Vw) if the children, parents, spouse (o) t (e) or partner actually belong to the family of the sponsor. The sponsor in the Netherlands must demonstrate that his or her children, parents, spouse or partner actually belong to his family when the sponsor enters the Netherlands and that this actual family relationship has not been broken. In order to assume family life between parent (s) and adult children, there must be a more than usual relationship of dependence (more than normal emotional relationships) between the adult child and his parent (s). In the event that the adult child is young adult, the respondent assumes family life without the existence of a more than usual dependency relationship.

7. In order to answer the question whether there is a young adult, a connection is sought with the policy as described in paragraph B7 / 3.8.1 of the Vc. This shows that the respondent assumes family life between parents and an adult child who is a young adult, lives with his parent (s) as a family, does not provide for himself, and has not formed an independent family by entering into a marriage or relationship. The explanatory notes to this policy show that the respondent assumes young adulthood in that sense in children aged 18 to approximately 25 years. The defendant determines on the basis of an individual assessment whether the young adult has always belonged and still belongs to the family of the parents.

8. The Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State commented on this in the judgment referred to by the defendant in the defense: “(…) although (…) from the jurisprudence of the ECtHR does not follow a maximum age until when an adult foreign national should be classified as a young adult, the age limit of about 25 years set by the Secretary of State is not unreasonable in view of this case law. "

9. The defendant further noted in the defense that the older the adult child is, the earlier it can be assumed that the child is able to stand on its own two feet. It cannot be ruled out that the circumstances of the individual case necessitate a different opinion. However, the defendant stated that no such circumstances were found in the case of the claimant. That he can stand on his own two feet follows from the statements as taken into account in the contested decision. Plaintiff is not financially dependent on sponsor and does not need her for daily care. In the questionnaire submitted with the application, the sponsor also stated that the claimant sometimes made money.

10. The court states first and foremost that the claimant has requested a return trip. This means that the reference time is the date on which the referee entered the Netherlands. The file shows that this was in May 2017. Plaintiff was then 27 years old. The defendant therefore took the wrong age as the starting point in the contested decision (28 years). The respondent also wrongly considered in the contested decision that the sponsor stated that the claimant is not financially dependent on her. The report of the hearing with the sponsor (p. 7) shows that the sponsor stated that the plaintiff is financially dependent on her. Her husband (not the father of the children), who also resides in Lebanon, gives the children money at her request. She also indicated this in the questionnaire that was submitted with the application. Although she noted that the plaintiff could occasionally earn some money in Lebanon, she explained during the hearing that this does not mean more than that the plaintiff (and his brother) can do a job about once a month for which they then get about 20 euros. In the court's opinion, therefore, it cannot be said that the plaintiff provides for his own subsistence. Furthermore, it is not disputed that the claimant has not formed an independent family by entering into a marriage or relationship.

10. In early 2012, after the divorce of their parents, the plaintiff and his brother and sister were taken to Hama by their father against their will. They could not have had contact with their mother for a long time. Eventually they managed to flee and were reunited with their mother in Lebanon. Contrary to the primary decision, the defendant acknowledged in the contested decision that this should not be enforced against claimants and that the family relationship cannot therefore be considered to have been broken. For that reason, the respondent saw reason to invite both the sponsor and the plaintiff's brother and sister for interviews. It is not clear why the plaintiff was not invited to an interview, now that he is in the same circumstances as the other children. The mere fact that the claimant is a few years older than his brother and sister is insufficient to conclude that he no longer belongs to his mother's family as a young adult. The court is therefore of the opinion that the defendant could not have taken the position without further motivation that there are no special, individual circumstances that make the claimant - despite being older than 25 years - still qualify as a young adult. who still belongs to his mother's family.

10. The fact that the claimant has not submitted a valid background statement is in itself insufficient to be able to reject the application. The court hereby refers to its ruling today in the case of the plaintiff's brother, case number AWB 19/8007.

10. The court declares the appeal well founded, annuls the contested decision and orders the defendant to take a new decision within six weeks, taking into account what has been considered in this decision.

10. The court orders the defendant to pay the legal costs incurred by the claimant. Pursuant to the Administrative Costs (Administrative Costs) Decree for the legal assistance provided by a third party, the court sets these costs at € 1,050 (1 point for submitting the notice of appeal and 1 point for appearing at the hearing, with a value per point of € 525 and a weighting factor 1). The defendant must also reimburse the court fee paid by the claimant.
