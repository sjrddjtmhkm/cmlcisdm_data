2 Facts
2.1.
Parties were married on July 7, 2001 to the exclusion of any community. In art. 7 of the marriage conditions of the parties stipulate the following:

“1. The costs of the joint household… shall be paid on the basis of the spouses' income in proportion to that; insofar as these incomes are insufficient, these costs will be paid out of everyone's capital in proportion to that.

These costs also include premiums for customary insurance, the rent for the matrimonial home and interest on loans taken out to finance things intended for the common household, such as the matrimonial home, the holiday home, the household effects and the family car (s). ).

2. A spouse who, in any calendar year, has contributed more to the cost of the household than his share under the foregoing, is entitled to recover the excess contribution from the other spouse. "

Art. 9 of the prenuptial agreement of the parties contains the following provision:

“The spouses undertake, for each calendar year, to offset each other of their income after deduction of that which has been spent for the joint household… in the sense that one spouse obtains a claim against the other spouse in the amount of half of what remains on its side as referred to above. If the spouses get a mutual claim against each other, the claims will be offset by the relevant statement to the amount of the smallest claim. "

2.2.
On June 30, 2015, a divorce petition was filed with the court (which date is the reference date for the settlement of the prenuptial agreement). The marriage was dissolved by decision of May 4, 2016. This decision was entered in the registers of civil status on 4 May 2016.

2.3.
Parties keep the house at the [address] in [residence 2], in a simple community.

3 Scope of Dispute
in convention 3.1.
[plaintiff in convention, defendant in counterclaim] claims that the court by judgment, as far as possible enforceable with stock,

1) allocates the assets described in the subpoena to [defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] subject to [plaintiff in convention, defendant in counterclaim] to pay an amount of € 15,946, - and also to direct it there. a period of six months after the judgment [plaintiff in convention, defendant in counterclaim] to be rendered in this judgment will be released from the joint and several liability of the loans for the security of which mortgages have been placed on the registered property for the benefit of Rabobank;

2) if [defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] lets the period referred to under 1 expire unused or is unable to discharge [plaintiff in convention, defendant in counterclaim] from the said joint and several liability, that

3) [defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] condemns to settle the pension rights accrued by [defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] in his management BV, on the understanding that for settlement of those rights to [claimant in convention, defendant in counterclaim] is due an amount of € 29,541, which amount [defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] will pay to an insurance company designated by [plaintiff in convention, defendant in counterclaim] to purchase an annuity by [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim];

(4) [defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] orders the costs of this action, stipulating that all costs related to the sale of the registered property, including brokerage and notary costs, and all costs directly or indirectly related to the sale and delivery of that registered property will be charged to [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim].

3.3.
The court will further discuss the claims of the parties insofar as they are relevant to the assessment of the dispute.

in counterclaim

3.2.
[defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim] requests that the court determine by judgment, as far as practicable in stock, the manner of distribution of the limited community of property existing between the parties and the manner of settlement of the prenuptial agreement as described under the Numbers 25 to 30 of the statement of defense, also containing a claim in the counterclaim and [Plaintiff in convention, defendant in the counterclaim] condemns payment thereto.

3.3.
[Claimant in convention, defendant in counterclaim] has put up a defense.

3.4.
The court will further discuss the claims of the parties insofar as they are relevant to the assessment of the dispute.

4 Reasons of the Decision
4.1.
The parties' claims are interrelated in such a way that they are assessed jointly.

4.2.
The parties stated at the hearing that they want to pay in accordance with the prenuptial agreement and that they want to distribute the simple community between them, consisting of the matrimonial home and the associated mortgage debts to the bank. The court therefore understands the claims of the parties in such a way that they serve to set off any saved income under Art. 9 of the prenuptial agreement, or recovery on the basis of art. 7 of the prenuptial agreement, and to divide the simple community. Below, the court will deal with the items mentioned by the parties in that context.

The home and mortgage loans at Rabobank

4.3.
In a simple community, the parties keep the former marital home at the [address] in [residence 2], and the associated mortgage loans from Rabobank with numbers 1141.9126.43, 1141.9128.13, 1141.9128.21, 1141.9135.50 and 1141.9140.18 , as described in the summary included in the subpoena under point 3. [Claimant in convention, defendant in counterclaim] has argued that the home must be allocated to [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim]. However, [defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] has stated that he cannot finance the takeover of the matrimonial home, which [plaintiff in convention, defendant in counterclaim] has not disputed. The court will therefore determine that the house must be sold, that the parties are obliged to pay half of the equity on the half and that any surplus value on the half is shared between the parties.

4.4.
The parties stated at the hearing that the house has been for sale for four years. [Claimant in convention, defendant in counterclaim] has the assertion of [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim] that she and the [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim] instructed the broker to do so (cf. point 5 of the conclusion of answer, also containing claim in counterclaim), not disputed. The court therefore assumes that a real estate agent has already been instructed to sell the house, so that for that reason alone the woman's claim to appoint a real estate agent chosen by the court will be dismissed. The court will understand that there is already a broker in which the parties have sufficient confidence.

4.5.
[defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] has not put forward a defense against the claim of [plaintiff in convention, defendant in counterclaim] that the parties will comply with the asking and asking price determined by the broker and will cooperate with the sale and delivery of the house. The court will therefore instruct the parties to conform to any adjustments to the asking and asking price of the house by the broker who currently has the assignment to sell the house. The court will also determine that both parties are obliged to cooperate in the conclusion of a purchase agreement and in the execution of a notarial deed of delivery regarding the house. There are no terms to reject the claimed penalty so that it will be awarded. This will be ex officio moderated and maximized as stated below in the operative part.

4.6.
[defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] has stated that the sales costs must be borne by the parties in half. [Claimant in convention, defendant in counterclaim] has claimed that [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim] will be ordered to pay all costs related to the sale and delivery of the home. Now that there is a house that the parties keep in common ownership, the court sees no reason to order [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim] to pay the costs related to the sale and delivery of the house. The court will determine that each of the parties is obliged to bear half of the costs of the sale and delivery of the house.

The home acquisition debt of € 110.00 and the current account debt

4.7.
[defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim] has stated that the parties have a current account debt to [name eg] in the amount of € 148,906. It concerns, according to [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim], a loan that was used to cover the costs of the joint household, such as renovation costs and costs related to the mortgage (see point 13 of the conclusion of the answer, also containing claim in counterclaim). At the hearing, [defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] stated that there was also an owner-occupied home debt of [parties, for example] worth € 110,000. This has arisen, the court understands, because the joint debt of parties from the mortgage construction depot has been repaid by means of [name bv], or directly by [name bv].

4.8.
[Claimant in convention, defendant in counterclaim] has not contested the existence of the debts as such. It has argued that it did not count and that it therefore does not bear any liability or obligation to pay for these debts, while, moreover, expenditure did not relate to household costs.

4.9.
Now that [defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] has not stated or substantiated that [plaintiff in convention, defendant in counterclaim] (together with him) has incurred the debts in question or in any other way (together with him) has become liable for this debts, the court will assume that the debts have only been incurred by [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim] itself and that only [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim] is liable towards [name bv]. The claim for a declaration that the [plaintiff in convention, defendant in the counterclaim] is 50% liable for these debts (cf. point 27 of the statement of defense, also claim in the counterclaim) will therefore be turned down.

4.10.
The court understands that [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim] also wanted to state that the value of the debts under art. 7 of the prenuptial agreement must be included in the settlement between the parties (see points 14 and 15 of the statement of defense, also containing the counterclaim). The court considers as follows: The court sees no grounds or terms on the basis of which the costs of the renovation of the communal house would not fall within the scope of “costs of the joint household”. After all, the house is communal and nothing shows that the renovation costs have only been incurred for one party. Based on art. 7 of the prenuptial agreements were served by [claimant in convention, defendant in counterclaim] and [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim] in proportion to the income of both spouses and insofar as this income is inadequate, from everyone's property proportionally, these expenses (and other household expenses). [defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] has not put forward anything that can be assumed to have contributed more than his share from his income or from his assets. The mere fact that he has entered into debts to cover the costs of the renovation (or the costs of the household in general) cannot therefore lead to him being obliged to do so on the basis of art. 7 of the prenuptial agreement is entitled to a compensation claim. After all, it is quite possible that [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim], given the size of his assets (including the value of the shares he held in [name bv]), the costs of the renovation and finance the other costs of the household up to the amount of these debts. For this reason already, [defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] no claim arises from art. 7 paragraph 2 of the prenuptial agreement. It has also been established that the value of the current account debt and the home acquisition debt to [name bv] need not be included in the settlement between the parties.

[name eg]

4.11.
[Claimant in convention, defendant in counterclaim] is entitled to settlement of the cash and cash equivalents present in [name eg] on the reference date, which cash qualifies as accumulated profits. However, the mere fact that [name bv] held liquid assets as at the reference date cannot, however, result in these resources being included in the settlement between parties as accumulated profits. Now that [claimant in convention, defendant in counterclaim] has not further substantiated why in this case there is a situation as referred to in art. 1: 141 paragraph 4 of the Dutch Civil Code, the court will reject this argument of [claimant in convention, defendant in counterclaim].

Bank account balance

4.12.
[Claimant in convention, defendant in counterclaim] has stated that [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim] had a positive balance on his bank account of € 18,642 as of the reference date, which balance qualifies as excess income for settlement between the parties. [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim] has not disputed that he had a positive balance of € 18,642 in his bank account on the reference date. [defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] has stated that the balance of the assets of [defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] (in court understands: the balance of his saved income) is negative because he has a current account debt are BV has € 148,000. [Claimant in convention, defendant in counterclaim] has not disputed that the current account debt must be taken into account in determining the balance of the surplus income of [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim]. The court will therefore assume that the balance of the man's saved income is negative, so that nothing can be settled between the parties on this basis.

4.13.
[defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] also stated at the hearing that it appears from the tax return 2014 that he paid € 12,656 to the tax authorities and that he sees this as an outstanding amount. Now that [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim] has not explained at all on what grounds the payment to the tax authorities is eligible for set-off between parties, the court will reject this argument.

The endowment insurance

4.14.
The parties agreed at the hearing that the value of the endowment insurance of € 11,369.00 should be shared by half between the parties. The court will therefore order [defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] to pay to [plaintiff in convention, defendant in counterclaim] € 5,684.50.

Child benefit refund

4.15.
The parties agreed at the hearing that the repayment by [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim] of the child benefit for 2014 of € 14,000 should be borne in half by both parties. The court will therefore order [plaintiff in convention, defendant in counterclaim] to pay [defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] of € 7,000.

4.16.
[Plaintiff in convention, defendant in counterclaim] stated that she had incurred private childcare costs, which are eligible for set-off between the parties. Now that [claimant in convention, defendant in counterclaim] has not explained at all on what grounds these costs should be settled between the parties, the court will reject this argument.

Pension rights

4.17.
[Claimant in convention, defendant in counterclaim] has stated, referring to the 2016 audit report submitted by her, that [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim] accrued a pension of € 58,104.00 (at least as per DGA) within [name bv] as at reference date. that in the annual accounts as of that date a provision has been made for the pension in the amount of that amount) and that she is entitled to equalization of this amount. [defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] is therefore, according to [plaintiff in convention, defendant in counterclaim], obliged to deposit with an insurance company to be designated by [plaintiff in convention, defendant in counterclaim] an amount of € 29,541.00 . [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim] has not disputed that [claimant in convention, defendant in counterclaim] is in principle entitled to a deposit of € 29,541.00, but has stated that the B.V. would have insufficient cash after payment to pay the pension obligation to [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim].

4.18.
Based on art. 2 paragraph 1, in connection with art. 1 paragraph 4, preamble and under a, WVPS, [claimant in convention, defendant in counterclaim] is entitled to equalization of the pension entitlement accrued by [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim] as DGA during [marriage name]. Generally speaking, the requirements of reasonableness and fairness governing the legal relationship between ex-spouses will mean that the equalized spouse who, as a DGA, controls the legal person in which the pensionable entitlement is to be paid, must arrange for payment to an external pension insurer. of the capital required for the part of the pension entitlement accruing to the other spouse (calculated according to commercial value). However, if at the time of the divorce there is insufficient capital available to both pay off the share of the spouse entitled to equalize and to leave enough capital in the company to (again calculated at commercial value) the amount required with the share of the equalization To cover the spouse's corresponding pension entitlement, the deficit will in principle have to be shared, in proportion to the ratio to which the equalization in accordance with art. 3 paragraph 1 WVPS leads. In view of all the circumstances of the case, the judge can decide that there is no entitlement to (full) payment if the equalization obliges the spouse and if it proves disputed that the required cash cannot be released or obtained from elsewhere without continuity. of the business operations of the legal person and the related company (see HR 14 April 2017, ECLI: NL: HR: 2017: 693, NJ 2017/237; HR 14 February 2020, ECLI: NL: HR: 2020 : 276).

4.19.
In the present case, [claimant in convention, defendant in counterclaim] does not claim payment of the capital required to transfer to an external pension insurer the part of the pension claim against [name bv] that accrues to [claimant in defense, counterclaim] (ie the commercial value of the pension entitlement), but only payment of the value of the pension entitlement for which a provision has been made in the annual accounts of [name bv] (which, according to the court, concerns the fiscal value of the pension entitlement). [defendant in convention, claimant in counterclaim] has not argued that [name eg] has negative equity, but has stated that the equity is unknown, at least as of the reference date, at no more than € 57,000. Therefore, it must be assumed that [name bv] as of the date of divorce had sufficient assets (capital) to cover at least the value of the pension entitlement for which a provision is included in the annual accounts. [defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] has furthermore not stated anything about the commercial value of the part of the pension claim accruing to him that must be paid by [name bv] after payment of the amount claimed by [plaintiff in convention, defendant in counterclaim]. covered and has not made any statements about whether [name bv] would have been able to do so. In addition, [defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] has in no way substantiated that the required cash for the deposit of the amount of € 29,541, - cannot currently be released without jeopardizing the continuity of [name eg]. In view of the above, the court is of the opinion that [plaintiff in convention, defendant in counterclaim] is entitled to payment of the full amount to which she is entitled. However, [defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] is not personally obliged to pay that amount (which [plaintiff in convention, defendant in counterclaim] is currently claiming). After all, the obligation of [defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] to equalize means that he, as DGA, must ensure that [name bv] carries out this payment. This means that [defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] will be sentenced to ensure that [name bv] transfers an amount of € 29,541 to an external pension insurer to be appointed by [plaintiff in convention, defendant in counterclaim]. for the purchase of an annuity on behalf of [claimant in convention, defendant in counterclaim].

4.20.
The court understands that both [defendant in convention, plaintiff in counterclaim] and [plaintiff in convention, defendant in counterclaim] claim to be entitled to equalization of their accrued pension rights. It was stated by both parties at the hearing that these are small amounts that may not exceed the limit applied by pension funds. The parties have not further clarified the net value of the pension they have built up during the marriage. The court will therefore assume that this value is indeed not higher than that stated in art. 3 paragraph 3 WVSP, in connection with art. 66 paragraph 1 of the Pension Act, the amount referred to goes out, so that neither of them is entitled to equalization of the pension accrued by the other employed person.

4.21.
The legal costs will be compensated in the sense that each of the parties bears its own costs because the parties are ex-spouses.
