the appeal proceedings
2.1
On 16 October 2019, the man appealed against part of the aforementioned decision of 12 December 2018.

2.2
The woman filed a defense on 16 January 2020.

2.3
The oral hearing took place on 24 February 2020, with only the admissibility of the appeal being discussed, as stated in the notice for the hearing. Published are:

- the man's lawyer;

- the woman's lawyer.

2.4
The man, although properly summoned, did not appear in court.

2.5

2.6

2 Facts
3.1
To the extent relevant here, the contested decision, at the woman's request, pronounced the divorce between the parties and stipulated that the husband must pay her a living contribution of â‚¬ 700 per month, with effect from the date of entry of the decision in the registers of civil status.

The man had not appeared in the proceedings at first instance.

3 Appeal
3.2
The man appealed on October 16, 2019, therefore more than ten months after the date of the contested decision. In her defense, the woman argued that the appeal was brought too late. The court of appeal will determine whether the man has appealed the contested decision in time. Although the woman withdrew her defense on this point at the hearing, the question of whether the appeal was lodged in time is of public order and should therefore be assessed by the court of its own motion. The court considers this as follows.

3.3
Pursuant to Article 820, paragraph 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Rv), a spouse who did not appear in the proceedings at first instance may, contrary to the provisions of Article 358, paragraph 2 of the Rv, appeal against a decision requiring a divorce, divorce appeal or dissolution of the marriage after legal separation has been granted, lodge an appeal within three months of the service of this order to him in person or within three months of it having been served in another way and in accordance with the second member has been publicly announced. The public announcement is made by placing an extract of the decision in the Government Gazette, according to the second paragraph of Article 820 DCCP.

3.4
The man claims that he was unaware of the proceedings at first instance. He had already moved to his current address in Spain. The man only became aware of the divorce decision on July 27, 2019 by receiving it at his home address in Spain.

4 Reasons of the Decision
3.5
It has been found that the woman brought the divorce decision on 28 December 2018 to the public prosecutor's office of the Amsterdam District Court on the basis of Article 54 paragraph 2 Rv and publicly announced it on 7 January 2019 in the Government Gazette.

Subsequently, the woman ordered the execution of that order. According to a writ of July 18, 2019, the bailiff sent a copy of his writ and the contested decision to the receiving agency in Spain on the basis of Article 56 paragraph 1 DCCP, in accordance with the provisions of the Revised EC Service Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007, PbEU 2007, L 324 hereinafter: EBetVo II), for service to the man at the address [address] in [place A] (Spain). It is not apparent from the file that it was subsequently served under Spanish law since the certificate referred to in Article 10 of that regulation was not produced. However, it is not disputed between the parties that this service took place.

3.6
It has also been found that on 28 December 2018 the address of the man in Spain was known from the Register of Persons, as the woman also stated at the hearing and is also apparent from an email from her bailiff's office that she submitted. Since the man had no known place of residence or residence in the Netherlands at the time of service on 28 December 2018, but he did have a known place of residence in Spain, the divorce decision should have been served under Article 56 (1) DCCP in accordance with the rules of the EBetVo II. The service of December 28, 2018 is therefore invalid. This means that the appeal period only started when the contested decision was notified to the man in Spain, at any time from 18 July 2019, because at that time the requirements of Article 820 (1) DCCP were only met. Although it has not been established on which date service took place (according to the man on July 27, 2019), it is concluded that with the submission of the notice of appeal on October 16, 2019, the man brought an appeal in time. The man is therefore admissible in his appeal, so that the substantive treatment can be given. The court will adjourn the case to that end and order the parties to be summoned against a yet to be determined hearing.

3.7
This leads to the next decision.

5 Decision
The Council:

declares the man admissible in the appeal brought by him;

provides that the oral hearing of the case will continue on a date to be determined, at which date and time the parties and their lawyers will be summoned;

keeps any further decision.

This decision was made by mr. J.F. Miedema, mr. A.V.T. de Bie and mr. M. Fiege, in the presence of mr. C. de Bruin as registrar and was pronounced in public on March 17, 2020.
