III CHOICE OF SELECTION

I leave to my daughter, Mrs. [defendant], born in [place] on [date], the assets of my estate which she wishes to elect, under the obligation to transfer their value to my estate.

My named daughter must inform my heirs in writing within six (6) months after my death whether or not she wants to accept this bequest and if so, which goods she wishes to choose.

Payment scheme

If and insofar as prompt payment of the aforementioned contribution for my daughter is not financially feasible according to the standards of reasonableness and fairness and / or continuation of my business (namely Nail Line BV, but also my commercial property made available to this company at the [address ] in [place], known cadastral, [cadastral number]) without this decision would be seriously complicated, my daughter is not obliged to pay in cash but has the power to recognize the amount of the contribution as guilty. The payment will then be made in a maximum of ten equal annual installments, the first installment of which will be due on the first January following my death.

(...)

Interest

Interest is due annually on the unpaid part of the receivables, which must be determined by mutual agreement between my heirs. If they are unable to agree on this, interest will be payable annually equal to the average statutory interest of the year preceding the annual repayment on January 1.

Certainty

If one or more of the heirs so desire, my said daughter is obliged to provide security for the fulfillment of the aforementioned payment obligations.

(...)

HERITAGE

I appoint both my children as my sole heirs, in accordance with the statutory rules regarding place-filling, which place-filling will, if appropriate, go before any accretion. My son's inheritance, Mr. [Claimant], born in [place] on [date], is equal to his legal minimum inheritance (legitimate portion). The rest is for my named daughter.

(...)

VI VALUATION

The valuation of the goods is done by mutual agreement. In the absence of agreement between my heirs within eight months after my death, the valuation will have to be carried out by an expert.

VIII EXECUTIVE / RESOLUTION BINDING

I appoint my named daughter as executor, hereinafter referred to as the executor, to which appointment the following provisions apply:

In connection with the payment of the debts, the executor is authorized to cash in on the assets of my estate managed by him. The executor does not need to consult the heirs about the choice and the monetization, and permission is not required.

(...)

3. Representation

In the performance of his duties, the executor represents my heirs in and out of court. The executor can also act as a counterpart to himself (selbsteintritt).

(…)

5. Settlement regime provisions

In the interest of all those involved to ensure that my estate is properly settled, I expand the executor's task with the establishment of a government over the heirs of my heirs and appoint my named daughter as administrator.

(...)

2.5.
[defendant] has purely accepted the estate. [claimant] has accepted the estate as a beneficiary.

2.6.
Erflaatster owned two real estate, at the [address] and [address] in [place]. [defendant] had these real estate appraised on August 15, 2013 by a broker, who determined the joint value at € 650,000.00 as of August 15, 2013.

2.7.
[claimant] also had the real estate appraised. The broker engaged by him has determined the joint value of the properties at € 830,000.00.

2.8.
On October 22, 2013 [claimant] sent an email with the following content: "I think I was very clear in the last meeting, to see the settlement of the estate as a whole.

The items under which the household contents are in principle agreed, if we also agree on the

other points. Unfortunately, we do not get out of the valuation of the properties and I am free to make a proposal to get out.

To avoid even more work, costs, energy and long emails, I repeat the proposal (...)

Should [defendant] not agree with this, then we have to solve it differently and we need a 3rd appraiser. This 3rd appraiser can be determined by the 2 brokers who have already done the appraisals. The outcome of that valuation is then independent and binding ".

2.9.
In a document signed on November 8, 2013 by [claimant] and on November 10, 2013 by [defendant] with the subject “Establishment agreement valuation [address] and [address]”, the parties have agreed as follows:

“Both parties have applied for a valuation regarding properties [address] and [address]. The appraisals of broker MVGM, Mr [name of appraiser 1] (650k) and broker Lommers / Janssen / Steijlen, Hr. [name of appraiser 1] (830k) are far apart.

Both parties request a 3rd appraisal, carried out by a new independent appraiser appointed by the aforementioned appraisers.

Both parties agree and sign that the valuation value of the 3rd independent broker is binding. ”

2.10.
In a valuation report of 11 December 2013 from Colliers International, the market value, free of rent and or use of the properties, is set at a value of € 700,000.00. The appraisal report mentions [defendant] as client and states (under 1.4.) As one of the "special principles or special assignment as previously agreed with client" that it is assumed that the object is free of rent and use.

2.11.
By letter of 23 December 2013, the defendant communicated the following to [claimant]:

“I would like to make it clear that I accept the option of the will of my mother [name of testator] for the values ​​as discussed earlier and that have been accepted by both parties.

accepted.

Values ​​agreed together as discussed previously:

Home contents € 8,000

Company NLC € 8,000

We have not been able to agree on the value of the properties at the [address] and [address] in [place] together.

To this end, we have decided in consultation with each other to leave a 3rd broker the value

which will therefore be binding.

The valuation of Colliers has now shown that the properties are valued for an amount

of € 700,000.

On the basis of this information I let my advisor mr. [name of advisor] a final setup

in which, of course, the additional costs will be taken into account

of the past period and the upcoming costs. This concerns costs of valuation 3e

broker, extra costs adviser / notary, costs maintenance buildings, tax, costs

will executor etc. ”

2.12.
By e-mail of 4 January 2014, [claimant] wrote to [defendant]:

Dear [defendant],

Received writing about the 3rd appraisal.

Now that all amounts are known, the final balance can be drawn up.

Please provide a numerical explanation of these demonstrably incurred costs.

(…) ”

2.13.
By letter of 23 April 2014, legal aid provider DAS on behalf of [claimant] stated that the valuation by Colliers International was not based on the correct facts and circumstances, that [claimant] does not consider himself bound by that valuation and that he terminates the agreement.

2.14.
According to the notarial deed of June 8, 2017, [defendant], in her capacity as executor (resolution administrator), has surrendered all the property of the estate to herself. The deed contains the following: I. INTRODUCTION (…)

According to a letter to her brother [plaintiff] of 23 December two thousand and thirteen [defendant] stated that she wishes to make full use of the aforementioned option, which implies that she prefers all the assets of hereditary inheritance II. ) the property of inheritance inheritance and therefore the property chosen by [defendant] include in any case: 1. Registered property to be reported (rb: the house at [address] at [place] and the business premises [address] at [place ]);

2.RB shares to be reported: the shares of Nail Line B.V.);

(…)

"V. SUBMISSION OBLIGATION / FURTHER PROCESSING OF THE ESTATE

As quoted above from the optional provisions in the will, [defendant] is obliged to transfer the value of the elected goods to the estate. The extent and method of the contribution as well as the assumption and / or other settlement of the debts of the inheritance inheritance will also have to be determined and settled between inheritance heirs, that is to say, without further interference from me, notary. This deed is therefore limited to the aforementioned issue of the optional legacy. "

3.2.
[defendant] puts up a defense.

3.3.
Insofar as relevant, the statements of the parties will be discussed below.

4 Reasons of the Decision

Preface. 4.1.
This case revolves around the settlement of the estate of the deceased and the claimant's share in it. In the first place, the parties disagree on a. The size and composition of the estate; b. the reference date for the valuation;

c. the valuation of the various assets;

d. the debts to be included in the estate and

e. In the second place, the parties discuss the donations that the deceased gave to [the defendant] while living and the valuation thereof. In the third place, the next issue is the choice of option granted to [the defendant], the obligation to contribute and the issue of the Finally, the way in which [defendant] as an executor has fulfilled his task plays a role. The court will discuss the various subjects in the order mentioned. Prior to this, the court will discuss the background of the dispute, the content of the will, the different positions of [claimant] and [defendant] and whether or not liquidation must take place first. In short, the court outlines the assessment framework against which the various subjects and, ultimately, the claims of [claimant] will be assessed.

The conclusion is that no final decision is yet possible. First, an expert report will be obtained in various areas on the value to be assigned to certain assets. The parties will also have to further comment by deed on a number of concretely indicated subjects that are important in order to be able to decide on the size of the estate, the debts that must be included in the estate and the determination of the share of [claimant]. .

I. Background, will and positions of [claimant] and [defendant]

background

4.2.
The parties are the children of the deceased. The testator and [defendant] lived together in the house belonging to the testator's property at the [address] in [place] and had a joint household. The testator and [defendant] also jointly ran the company Nail Line BV. This company is located in the commercial property that also belongs to the deceased to the [address] in [place]. The testator started this business in 2003. In 2007, the testator transferred to [defendant] shares in Nail Line BV.

[Claimant] has not denied that there has been little to no contact between him and his mother in recent years before her death.

will

4.3.
In her will, the testator gave her two children her heirs. The inheritance of [claimant] has been determined by the deceased as to the size of his legal inheritance (legitimate portion); she left the rest to [defendant].

In addition, she has granted [defendant] an optional legacy which, at the option of [defendant], includes all the assets of her estate against the obligation to transfer the value of the assets she chooses to the estate. The testator has determined that if prompt payment of the contribution is not financially feasible for [defendant] according to the criteria of reasonableness and fairness, or if the continuation of Nail Line BV is seriously hampered, [defendant] does not have to pay the amount of the contribution in cash. but may remain guilty and pay in installments for a period of 10 years.

Finally, [defendant] has been designated in the will as an executor and resolution administrator with far-reaching powers.

position [claimant]

4.4.
[claimant] is heir and, as the child of the deceased, legitimacy. Pursuant to Article 4:63 of the Dutch Civil Code, in conjunction with Articles 4:79 and 4:80 of the Dutch Civil Code, a legitimate may obtain a claim against the joint heirs by claiming his legitimate portion. In that case, he obtains a monetary claim that is classified as a debt of the estate. [Plaintiff] made an additional appeal on his legitimate portion (summons 21 on summons) by summons and claimed to determine the size of the additional legitimate portion due to him, insofar as the legitimate portion exceeds the inheritance due to him (item V of the petitum). The question arises whether and to what extent this claim has practical significance, now that the deceased has determined the inheritance due to [claimant] on its legitimate portion. In any event, insofar as his inheritance turns out to be less than the legitimate portion due to him, [claimant] is the creditor of the estate. has emerged from the comparative proceedings that the estate has been beneficially accepted. In principle, this means that the estate must be liquidated before it can be distributed. The court then discusses this under point 4.55. and next.

As indicated above, the inheritance of [claimant] is equal to his legitimate portion. This is the inheritance to which a descendant of the testator in a straight line is always entitled and which is not at the free disposal of the testator. When determining the inheritance of [plaintiff] it may therefore be questioned to what extent the provisions in the will of inheritance that lead to the legitimate portion that is due to [plaintiff] should be taken into account.

The size of the legitimate portion is determined by the value of the assets of the estate, plus the gifts to be considered, less the debts of the estate. This follows from Article 4:65 BW. Gifts that should be taken into account include gifts to a descendant who is also a legitimate person. (Article 4:67 BW). In this case, these are gifts that the deceased will have made to (one of) her children.

According to the law, only the debts mentioned in Article 4: 7 under a to c and under f are taken into account in the calculation of the legitimate portion. This means, among other things, that the costs of execution are not taken into account in the calculation.

position [defendant]

4.5.
[defendant] is legatee and heir.

She has accepted the bequest, according to her letter to [claimant] of 23 December 2013 (prod 5 by summons), and has opted for all assets from the estate. Although the latter may not be directly deduced from the aforementioned letter, it has been included in the notarial deed of 8 June 2017 regarding the issue of bequest (prod 6 by writ of summons). [claimant] has not disputed that either. With the acceptance of the bequest, [defendant] has also undertaken to transfer the value of the goods she has chosen into the estate. [defendant] is therefore also the debtor of the estate.

The court's decision on the dispute between the parties about the value of the estate of the estate also determines the amount of the debt owed by [defendant].

According to the payment scheme that the deceased has included in the will, the defendant may remain indebted to the amount of the contribution if it is not financially feasible for her according to the criteria of reasonableness and fairness or if the continuation of Nail Line B.V. severely complicated. Although it is still far from clear in the proceedings which debts are to be included in the estate and to what amount exactly - the court will discuss this further - it is clear that the total value of the goods chosen by [the defendant] - the entire assets of the estate - will far exceed its share in the estate. The issue of the legacy without simultaneous payment of the contribution debt could therefore result in payment of the creditors of the estate not being (fully) possible and / or depending on the payment by [defendant] in installments as provided in the testamentary payment arrangement. This would be in conflict with the statutory regulation as included in Article 4: 120 BW and the ranking system as included in Article 4: 7 BW and detract from the legally assured redress position of the estate's creditors. This will have to be the starting point when assessing the dispute between the parties about the issue of the bequest to [defendant] and the question of what consequences should be attached to it.

Apart from being a legatee / debtor, [defendant] is also an heir. Her share consists of the balance of the estate minus the share of [claimant].

Finally, [defendant] has been designated in the will of the deceased as executor and resolution administrator with the power to distribute. As an executor, [defendant] has been granted the authority to act for himself.

As a result, [defendant] has, compared to [plaintiff], acquired a considerably stronger position in her will to control the settlement of the estate. However, that does not mean that she should not have to take into account her brother's legitimate interests. This is not only enshrined in the statutory provisions regarding the exercise of the executive and the administration, but heirs also have to act towards each other according to the requirements of reasonableness and fairness.

Can we already distribute?

4.6.
On balance, the claims of [claimant] amount to the distribution of the estate. However, he has accepted the estate beneficially. Article 4: 202 paragraph 1, preamble and under a, of the Dutch Civil Code provides that an estate must be liquidated in accordance with the regulations of section 4.6.3 of the Dutch Civil Code if it has been accepted by one or more heirs under the privilege of inventory, unless there is a payment to the satisfaction of the due debts and bequests an authorized executor who can demonstrate that the estate of the estate is more than sufficient to pay all the debts of the estate.

4.7.
The latter situation arises here: [defendant] was appointed executor in the sense referred to here in the will of the deceased. Furthermore, in her productions 51 and 52 [defendant] has mapped out all the assets of the estate. [Claimant] also took this position as a starting point in his production 40. Although the parties disagree on the number of components and do not agree on the value of the components, the positions of both [defendant] and [claimant] show a positive balance in all cases. This means that it is clear between them that the estate of the estate is more than sufficient to pay all debts of the estate. The fact that there is not enough cash in the estate to pay all the creditors of the estate is separate from that.

4.8.
The conclusion is therefore that no liquidation needs to take place in accordance with the provisions of section 4.6.3., And that this does not impede the division of the estate.

II. The size and composition of the estate

Inventory (claim under I)

4.9.
The court rejects the claim of [plaintiff] to convict [defendant] to have a notarised sworn inventory drawn up and to issue all related documents. In view of exhibits 51 and 52 submitted by [defendant], it is not possible to see what interest [claimant] still has in that claim. As far as the issue of documents is concerned, [claimant] has filed a separate claim against this. The court will now discuss this.

Issue of documents (claim under II)

4.10.
The [claimant] has demanded the delivery of the documents mentioned in marginal 24 of the preliminary summons. Apart from the fact that [defendant] stated that she had already made a large part of the requested documents available to [plaintiff] before, she has brought in a great many exhibitions in the course of the proceedings. Taking into account that the oral hearing was adjourned at the request of (the lawyer of) [defendant], after which [defendant] was given the opportunity by court to bring additional documents and [claimant] was able to respond to them. [claimant] may be expected to have specifically stated in his response, but no later than the oral hearing, which documents he still missed. In any case, the court does not consider it her duty to independently search in the (estimated) 1,500 pages that have been produced since the preliminary subpoena for the documents that [claimant] has asked for, but has not received. The court therefore rejects this claim. It is also questionable whether [plaintiff] is harmed in this way in his interests. If, in the remainder of these proceedings, it would appear that the court needs for its judgment certain documents that, although [defendant] disposes of them or may be deemed to have disposed of them, the court may conclude that they are of the opinion that eight.

The goods.

- agreement on the value of the goods?

4.11.
Strictly speaking, the legacy of the positive assets currently consists only of the claim against [defendant] on account of the contribution owed by it. After all, the estate of the estate is transferred to [defendant] in the context of the issue of the bequest. by accepting the bequest granted to her, she has also undertaken to reimburse the estate for the value of the goods to be delivered to her. However, the notarial deed of 8 June 2017 for the issue of the bequest shows that, although the goods have been transferred to [defendant], the [defendant] has not complied with her obligation to submit a contribution. The court refers to the passage, included under V of the deed (see 2.14 above). Irrespective of the answer to the question whether, as [the claimant] has claimed, this should lead to the cancellation of the issue, which will be discussed below under 4.55 et seq., It is important to determine what the value of the estate of the estate and / or the amount of the obligation to contribute.

4.12.
[defendant] takes the view that the parties have reached an agreement on the value of the goods, referring to the 2.11. letter of 23 December 2013 as far as it meant by stating that it has reached agreement with [claimant] on the value of all assets of the estate, the court cannot follow her, because a simple comparison of the legal consideration 4.7. The stated statements of assets of [Claimant] and [Defendant] already follow that they do not agree on the size and composition of the estate.

4.13.
The letter mentioned does not mention all the goods of the community. At best, it can be deduced from the letter of [defendant] of 23 December 2013 that according to her an agreement has been reached on the value of the properties at the [address] and [address] in [place], the contents of the heiress' property, and the value of the shares of Nail Line BV. But the court does not follow that position either.

4.14.
The in legal consideration 2.9. The “settlement agreement” shown cannot be explained in any other way than that the parties have agreed therein that the brokers already engaged by each of them would appoint a third broker together and that their valuation would be binding. The fact that [plaintiff] emailed [defendant] on November 12, 2013 that she had to regard this drafting agreement drawn up by him as not being sent, has no further significance: what the parties have agreed in that agreement (namely: that a third party would be appointed), has been executed, without [plaintiff] further objecting. However, [claimant] takes the view that he cannot be bound by that agreement. The court follows him in this.

4.15.
The mere fact that the will gives [defendant] the authority to settle her mother's estate does not mean that she should not be concerned with the legitimate interests of her brother, who is the only other heir. [defendant] has, although apparently at the request of the third broker (Colliers) himself, consulted Colliers about the valuation basis. But that was precisely not the intention. Given the discussion that the parties had about the valuation of the real estate, [defendant] could have been expected to be extremely reserved with questions from Colliers: she should have referred either Colliers to the two brokers to answer those questions. that had previously been brought in by the parties themselves, or she should have involved her brother in answering Colliers' questions. However, she did neither one nor the other. Nor has it been alleged or established that Colliers itself contacted [claimant] about the valuation basis. All this means that it is no longer possible to speak of an impartial appraisal, which was precisely the purpose of the settlement agreement, and that [claimant] cannot be held to Colliers's appraisal.

4.16.
The above also has consequences for the value of the other goods mentioned in the letter of [defendant]. After all, it is clear that [claimant] wanted to see the estate as a whole and only agreed with the other “points” if the parties agreed on the value of the real estate. Now that this agreement is (still) not there, it must be held that the parties do not agree on the value of the estate of the estate. This means that that value must still be determined. Considering the will of the deceased, the court will appoint experts who will determine the value of the goods on which the parties have not agreed. For this purpose, the court will first make an inventory of which goods belong to the estate.

- which goods are part of the estate

4.17.
A comparison of the parties' assets (production 40 of [claimant]; exhibits 50 and 51 of [defendant]) shows that they do not disagree that at least the following goods are part of the estate:

the real estate to the [address] and [address]

the value of the shares in the private company Nail Line B.V.

balances of bank accounts

household effects

jewelry

a BMW car

4.18.
In dispute is whether the following belongs to the estate:

7. rights under term life insurance

- the reference date

4.19.
The will does not determine at what time the value to be entered should be determined. Since the bequest and thus the claim for delivery against contribution of the value is obtained with the death of the deceased, it is assumed that the value to be contributed is the value per day of death, unless the deceased has determined otherwise. The latter therefore does not occur.

4.20.
Reasonableness and fairness may mean that a different time can count as the reference date. According to [Claimant], that situation arises, referring to HR April 13, 2007, ECLI: NL: HR: 2007: AZ8521 (NJ 2007/219). However, the case tried in that judgment is not sufficiently similar to the present case. More specifically, the court has not found that [defendant] has lived in the house for free since the deceased's deceased, now that, in the absence of defense on the part of [plaintiff], it must be presumed that she has the mortgage attached to the house. has borne expenses and paid from its own resources. In addition, contact between the parties has stood still for a long time (two years), without one of them having seen any reason in the course of time to take further steps (legal or otherwise) to reach a division. Otherwise, [claimant] has not provided sufficient facts or circumstances that make it unacceptable, based on standards of reasonableness and fairness, to assume a reference date other than that of the date of death.

- a closer look at the property of the community

Ad 1. The real estate

4.21.
Upon further judgment, the court will appoint an expert to answer the following questions:

what do you think is the correct measure of the valuation of the real estate at the [address] and [address] in [place], taking into account that part of the business premises has been let?

based on that measure, what is the value of both properties?

are there any other comments you want to make?

The court will point out to the expert that the parties disagree on the part of the commercial property ([address]) that has been let, and the part that is in use at Nail Line B.V. According to [claimant], 60% is in use at Nail Line B.V., and 40% is available for rental; according to [defendant] 84% has been made available to Nail Line B.V.

Ad 2. The shares of the deceased in Nail Line B.V.

4.22.
The parties do not agree on the value of these shares. In view of the above, the position of [defendant] that the parties have made a binding agreement about the value of the shares and that this value amounts to € 8,000.00. [claimant] states that the value of the shares is at least € 50,000.00. With reference to the 2013 balance sheet and the 2016 financial report of the company, he states that in 2013 and 2016, respectively, there was an inventory worth € 22,930.00, cars worth € 18,096.00, office machines worth € 2,321 , 00, debtors of € 12,077.40 (2013) and € 48,240.00 (2016), respectively, and there are inventories worth € 127,302.00, not counting the turnover generated of € 248,474.00 ( 2013) and € 249,271.00 (2016).

Upon further judgment, the court will appoint an expert and put the following questions to it:

what do you think is the most appropriate measure for the valuation of the shares of the deceased in Nail Line B.V.?

based on that measure, what is the value of those shares?

ad 3. Balances of bank accounts

4.23.
There is agreement between the parties about the existence of the following bank accounts and the balance on the date of death:

Rabo current account [account number] with a balance of € 1,001.75

ING bank account [account number] with a balance of € 1,649.36.

4.24.
The following accounts are in dispute:

4.24.1.
ABN AMRO [account number]:

[Claimant] argues that bank statements known to him show that an amount of € 227.80 was transferred monthly from the aforementioned ING account to this account number with ABN AMRO under the heading 'automatic collection period amount' with contract number [contract number].

According to [defendant] this is a flexible credit, of which she did not know the existence of the deceased's deceased. She claims that she closed the account after the death and that there was no balance on it. She has already informed [claimant] about this and indicated from the outset that he is free to verify this. According to her, ABN AMRO does not want to provide written information and the [claimant] should contact the ABN-AMRO bank itself.

The court considers that [claimant] is heir. As such, as a legal successor under general title, he has the option of checking the progress of the bankrupt's bank balance and requesting bank statements at the bank. To this extent, [defendant] rightly states that [claimant] could also have exercised his own rights here. However, it plays here that [defendant] stated at the hearing that she has the accounts of the deceased. [Plaintiff] and [defendant] are heirs as partners and are obliged to behave towards each other in accordance with the requirements of reasonableness and fairness (Section 3: 166 (3) in conjunction with Section 6: 2 of the Dutch Civil Code). The requirements of reasonableness and fairness mean that a participant in an estate has a right vis-à-vis the other partners to inspect documents that are part of that estate and that may be important in assessing the size and composition of that estate. The court assumes that [defendant] [plaintiff] will provide unimpeded access to the deceased's accounts, including, but not limited to, all data related to the deceased's bank accounts. In addition, the court took good note of the offer of (the lawyer of) [defendant] to bring further details into the proceedings. The court will give [claimant] the opportunity to take a further document to explain what insights into the administration of the deceased have brought him.

4.24.2.
OHRA [account number]

[claimant] has stated that from the aforementioned ING account, € 250.00 was transferred monthly to account number [account number], stating 'periodic

OHRA monthly savings account collection 'for account number [account number].

With reference to the production submitted by her, [defendant] 60 stated that the balance on that account at the time of death was € 97.24.

The court considers that such a low balance cannot be explained from the monthly transfers made by [claimant]. Here too, however, what has been considered above with regard to the account with ABN-AMRO: [claimant] could have requested information about this himself, and [defendant] should have given [claimant] the opportunity to inspect the documents. Here too, the court will give [claimant] the opportunity to take a further document.

4.24.3.
Delta Lloyd

[claimant] states that there is a savings product at Delta Lloyd, but does not substantiate that further. If the administration of the deceased (see above) does not provide any clarity on this point, the court will assume that there is no question of a savings account with Delta Lloyd.

Ad. 4. The contents

4.25.
According to [claimant] the contents are worth at least € 20,000.00, whereby he points out that the deceased had two Artifort banks, which he says are worth € 6,000.00 each and that she also owned two paintings by Pieter Alewijns , which are worth € 3,800.00 each.

4.26.
The defense of [defendant] that the parties have reached an agreement on a value of the contents of the deceased's estate of € 8,000.00 is rejected, in view of the above considerations. [defendant] disputes that the value of the contents of the deceased's estate is € 20,000.00.

4.27.
In this state of affairs, the court will also appoint an expert to be determined by judgment, which must assess the value of the inheritance's contents according to the composition and condition at the time of the deceased's death. As undisputed, it must be assumed that the contents included at least two Artifort sofas and two paintings by Pieter Alewijns. Unlike [claimant], the court does not need to inspect the household insurance policy, as it is generally known that the insured value reported on it concerns the replacement (or new) value of the household effects. The household contents insurance might be interesting if the entire contents of the landlord's property were brand new, but it has not been stated or proved that this was the case. The court points out that [claimant] must be given the opportunity to be present at the valuation and will instruct the expert (and [defendant]) in this respect.

Ad. 5. Jewelry

4.28.
[Claimant] assumes that the deceased will possess jewelry with a total value of € 10,000.00. According to [defendant], the deceased had a few old watches, a silver ring, a few cheap bracelets and a small gold ring.

The claims of [claimant] go no further than that the deceased had jewelry and that she worked in the cosmetic industry, in which it is important to appear well-groomed. With that he has not stated enough to be able to assume that the deceased has more jewelry than stated by [defendant]. Nor has he been able to demonstrate that the landlady had taken out separate jewelry insurance.

4.29.
The foregoing does not alter the fact that [defendant] has chosen all the goods from the estate of the deceased, and thus also the jewelery. She will also have to contribute the value of the jewelry. The court assumes that the expert whom she will appoint to value the contents will also be able to determine the value of the jewelry mentioned by [the defendant].

4.30.
The question to the expert thus reads:

what is the free market value of the contents of the house at the [address] in [place], including two Artifort benches and two paintings by Pieter Alewijns?

what is the free market value of the jewelery of the deceased, especially the watches, the bracelets, and the silver and gold ring?

The court reminds the expert (and [defendant]) that [claimant] must be present during the valuation.

Ad 6. The BMW car

4.31.
The deed of issue of the bequest (Exhibit 6 of [Claimant]) shows that the estate of the deceased had also included a BMW passenger car. The court rejects [plaintiff's] argument that [defendant] forfeited her share in this car because it would be a so-called concealed good (cf. article 3: 194 paragraph 2 BW). This is clearly not the case. In the notarial deed for the issue of the bequest, the car is included among the goods that fall under the bequest and which have been issued to [defendant]. This means that the value of the car must be brought into the estate by [defendant] and this is taken into account in the further settlement of the estate. The fact that the car played no role in the negotiations between the parties makes that no different. [claimant] assumes a value of the car of € 6,000.00. Now that [defendant] has not disputed that value, the court will also assume that value.

Ad 7. Rights under term life insurance

4.32.
[claimant] states that the deceased had a mortality risk, worth fl. 150,000.00 (€ 68,067.03). According to him, the home acquisition debt was repaid as of the date of death and also indicates that there was term life insurance and / or life insurance. [Claimant] further refers to a page from a Rabobank financing proposal of 6 September 1999, on which page 2 states: "Pledging rights / claims from a term life insurance policy in the name of [name of the deceased], amounting to NLG 150,000."

4.33.
According to [defendant], there is no term life insurance. She called about that. The financing referred to by [claimant] has either not been entered into or has been canceled prematurely.

4.34.
In the opinion of the court, it was up to [defendant] to pour clear wine about this, and there is much to be said about the quality of her dispute. For example, the answer to the question with whom she called (and when) was not given. In any case, it does not seem very plausible that the financing proposal has not been accepted: the court finds that on the document submitted by [claimant] it can be read that “if you take advantage of this offer… we request you ( …) Initial all pages of this proposal (…) ”and that the page in question is initialed under the heading“ client ”. [Defendant] did not even respond to the claim by [claimant] that the home acquisition debt has decreased. Partly because [defendant] has the administration of the deceased, much more could have been expected of her on this point. For the time being, subject to evidence to the contrary provided by [defendant], the court will assume that the estate included rights under a term life insurance policy, up to an amount of € 68,067.03. The court will allow [defendant] to provide evidence to the contrary.

Conclusion regarding the estate of the estate

4.35.
The conclusion is that there is still a lot of uncertainty about the value to be attributed to the estate of the estate, and therefore also about the size of [defendant's] obligation to contribute.

The debts of the estate

4.36.
There is also little agreement between the parties about the (size of) the debts of the estate.

After this, the court will only deal with debts insofar as they were discussed during the proceedings. That involves:

Loans from Rabobank

A debt to [name of creditor 1] and [name of creditor 2]

A debt to [name of creditor 3]

A tax claim on the property

Ad 1. Loans from Rabobank

4.37.
[defendant] states that the following loan agreements with Rabobank are debts of the estate:

[loan agreement number]

4.38.
With regard to loans with number [loan agreement number], [loan agreement number] and

[loan agreement number] [claimant] takes the view that these loans should not be taken into account when determining the size of the estate. According to information from Rabobank, these would be business loans. In addition, no statements were made of these loans in the tax return of the landlord under the box 3 capital. As the testator, she borrowed the money privately and made it available to Nail Line B.V. there is a claim on Nail Line B.V. who falls into the estate. According to [claimant], this is not apparent from the available documents either. Before further judging on this, the court will give [defendant] the opportunity to bring the underlying money loan agreements into question.
4.39.
This also applies to loans with number [loan agreement number] and [loan agreement number]. [plaintiff] states that [defendant] is co-debtor thereof, and that these debts must at least partly be borne by [defendant]. The court also wants to see the loan agreements for these loans.

4.40.
With regard to the loan with number [loan agreement number], there is uncertainty about the balance at the time of death. [claimant] states that it follows from a letter from Rabobank that the balance at the time of death was € 14,500.00, while according to [defendant] the balance was € 72,604.83. From the copy of bank statements provided by [defendant] as appendices 6.1 to 6.3 to production 51, it appears that the balance of the account with number [loan agreement number] on the date of death was € 72,604.83 and the balance of the account with number [number loan agreement] € 14,500.00. The court therefore presumes for the time being that the account numbers and the associated balances have been mistakenly mistaken in the letter from Rabobank that [claimant] refers to and that the balance of € 72,604.83 as stated on the account statement is correct. If the [claimant] finds data in the administration of the testator that demonstrates that this conclusion is not correct, he can still enter this data in the document he still has to take (see above under 4.24.1 to 4.24.3. ).

Ad 2. a debt to [name of creditor 1] and [name of creditor 2]

4.41.
[name of creditor 1] is the brother of the deceased; [name of creditor 2] is his partner. According to [defendant], the debtor's debt to them amounts to € 65,042.99. In doing so, she refers to a loan agreement of January 5, 2001, which states that the deceased will borrow NLG 120,000.00 from her brother and Mrs. [name of creditor 2], an appendix of April 26, 2012 and a statement of July 25, 2013.

4.42.
[Claimant] disputes that this debt was incurred by the deceased. He points out that no bank statements have been submitted showing that an amount of fl. 120,000.00 (€ 54,453.63) has been deposited in the bank account of the deceased and that the deceased has never included the aforementioned debt in her tax returns. In the event that the deceased would have borrowed the amount, the claim according to [claimant] is time-barred on January 5, 2011. Moreover, according to the appendix of April 26, 2012, [defendant] is co-debtor, as a result of which the debt is at least half (€ 27,226.82). [Claimant] further states that the stated amount of € 65,042.99 cannot be reconciled with the amount of € 54,453.63 stated in the loan agreement.

4.43.
In this case, the documents submitted by [defendant] do not provide compelling evidence of the existence of the alleged loan agreement. With those documents she has provided some evidence. The court will give her the opportunity to prove that the stated amount of NLG 120,000.00 (€ 54,453.63) has actually been made available to the deceased and has not yet been repaid. The court will then decide on the other defenses of [claimant] at a later stage. However, the court already wants to say that [defendant] has not given a satisfactory explanation for the difference between € 65,042.99 and € 54,453.63. During the court hearing, the court has understood from the information of Mr [name of creditor 1] and Ms [name of creditor 2] that they have taken out a mortgage loan or increased an existing mortgage for the loan amount, and that it has been agreed with the testator that she would pay the (variable) mortgage interest owed by them and a bonus interest. The difference would then have arisen because the variable mortgage interest was always paid, but the bonus interest was not. However, based on the documents submitted, it cannot be ascertained that at the time of her death there was a backlog in payment of € 10,589.36 (the difference between € 65,042.99 and € 54,453.63).

Ad 3. A debt to [name of creditor 3]

4.44.
The [claimant] has substantiated disputes that this is a loan to the deceased. He stated that this debt is not mentioned in the income tax return of the deceased, that the loan amount was transferred to the [defendant] bank account [account number] and that the signature at the bottom of the agreement submitted by [defendant] is also very different. of other signatures of testator. In the opinion of the court, [defendant] has insufficiently stated this, so that she will assume that the debt referred to here is not part of the estate.

Ad 4. ​​Tax claim

4.45.
[defendant] states, with reference to an e-mail from its advisor [name of advisor] (production 51 of [defendant], appendices 10.1 and 10.2), that the business premises at the [address] have been made available to Nail Line B.V. and that a (substantial) tax claim has arisen due to the death of the deceased, which has been passed on to [defendant].

4.46.
[Claimant] points out that [Defendant] only started to mention this alleged tax burden in the course of these proceedings. According to him, the e-mail from [name of adviser] submitted as Exhibit 37 does not show that any actual assessments have been / are being made, or that the tax authorities believe that it is yet to be settled. In addition, the post-clearance period is five years. Now that it has expired, no more can be claimed. In the event that a post-clearance recovery would be possible, [claimant] notes that there is no documentary evidence of the book value used for the commercial property that is partly attributable to Nail Line B.V. is leased, it is unclear what the value of the commercial property is (the court appoints an expert for this) and that in view of the leased floor space it is not correct that 84% of the industrial space is leased to Nail Line B.V. (such as what [defendant] assumes) but only 60%. Contrary to [defendant's] assertion, according to [plaintiff], no document has shown that the percentage of 84% would have been determined in consultation with the Inspector and that it would have been followed in the declarations 1B of the landlord since then. Nor does it appear that the tax authorities will also use the percentage of 84% when determining a possible IB debt.

4.47.
The court considers it desirable that it be informed by an expert on this point. In addition, the court imagines that the expert to be appointed will have the capacity of tax specialist and that the question will read as follows:

At the time of the death of the landlady, was there an asset made available within the meaning of paragraph 3.4.1 with regard to the real estate at the [address] in [place]? of the Wet IB 2001?

Does the size of the floor area in use play a role in determining the tax consequences of the posting scheme?

How do you assess the statement that it has been agreed with the Inspector that 84% of the income from assets provided is taxed in box 1 and 16% in box 3?

Has taxation been levied after the death of the landlord in connection with the provision of assets? If so, up to what amount? If not, why not?

How do you assess [claimant's] assertion that the five-year post-clearance period has expired and that therefore no more tax can be claimed?

Are there any other comments you wish to make that may be of interest to the judge?

Conclusion on the debts

4.48.
Again, it is not yet possible to determine the size of the debts of the estate.

In addition, [defendant] has stated that she has taken over the debts from the estate and has paid and / or paid her own debt. However, this statement is not supported in any way. It is not clear from which moment [defendant] started to pay the debts for his own account and which debts she pays for his own account. In addition, a legally valid assumption of debts requires that the creditors in question have agreed that [defendant] will pay the debts as his own debt and that [plaintiff] is released from the joint and several liability for those debts. As yet, no evidence of this has emerged. Under point 4.57. the court will return to the latter.

III. The gifts

4.49.
In order to determine the inheritance of [claimant], account must be taken of any gifts that the deceased will have made to her descendants while alive. The court refers to what it considered in section 4.4 above. has pointed out that the testator has transferred shares to [defendant] on 2 occasions in the past. On October 20, 1995 (Exhibit 21 of [defendant]), the deceased had in her capacity as director of the investment company AFM BV sold and transferred 120 shares to [defendant] at the purchase price of fl. 1.00 (€ 0.45). On April 20, 2007 (Exhibit 22 of [defendant]), 125 shares were handed over by the testator in her capacity as director of Nail Line B.V. sold and transferred to [defendant] at a purchase price of € 1.00. According to [claimant], on both occasions no real purchase price was used and in fact these are donations. In the absence of further information, [claimant] determines the amount of the donated successively at € 10,000.00 for the AFM shares and € 8,000.00 for the Nail Line BV shares. According to [defendant], the value of the shares was nil.

4.50.
If no real price has indeed been paid by [defendant] for the shares transferred in the past, this is a gift that, pursuant to Section 4:65 of the Dutch Civil Code, must be involved in the calculation of the legitimate portion, and therefore also in determining the share of [claimant] in the estate.

In response to [plaintiff's] assertions, the defendant did not provide any substantive explanation regarding the (background of the) share transfer AFM from which it can be deduced that it paid a real price for the shares it acquired. In doing so, it has not sufficiently substantiated the argument of [claimant] that the transfer involved a disguised gift. Now that there are no concrete connecting factors, the court will take into account the estimated value of € 10,000.00 by the [claimant] when calculating the inheritance of [claimant].

For the transfer of shares Nail Line B.V. things are different in 2007. Now that the court will appoint an expert to measure the value of the shares of the deceased in Nail Line B.V. the court will extend the question to the expert with a question about the value of the shares in Nail Line B.V. transferred to [defendant] in 2007.

4.51.
[Claimant] also wants to take into account the repayment of the loan to [name of creditor 3] and any other gifts from the deceased to [defendant]. The court has ruled that the debt to [name of creditor 3] cannot be considered as a loan to the testator and that she should therefore not be counted as an inheritance. Insofar as it has been established that payment of this debt has been made to the account of the deceased, this is therefore a gift that must be taken into account when determining the legal inheritance of [claimant]. The court may be brief about other gifts : For the time being, what [claimant] has put forward on this subject does not offer sufficient concrete leads to assume that such donations have been made.

4.52.
Finally, [claimant] is of the opinion that now the deceased has taken over the rent and charged only a small amount of € 85.00 per month to [defendant] for household costs, which also includes a donation that must be taken into account. be taken.

On the other hand, [defendant] has stated that there is no ground on which [claimant] can claim compensation for the costs of the household paid by the landlord. She and the testator had a household together, but no cohabitation agreement or an equivalent informal cohabitation relationship. [defendant] worked for Nail Line B.V. and has been withdrawn from the testator for cost reasons and to limit commuting. It was agreed that [defendant] would pay, among other things, the costs for the groceries, domestic help, garden and maintenance of the house. [defendant] only received a (minimum) salary from Paper Line B.V. on paper, but in reality this was never paid to her; that left the financial position of Nail Line B.V. not matter. In fact, [defendant] still has the necessary from Nail Line B.V. receive.

4.53.
The court understands that for years work and private life of the deceased and the [defendant] were mixed up, that the mother and daughter worked together in the company Nail Line B.V., that they lived together as a family and took care of each other. [Claimant] has not contradicted that factual situation either and it has not been stated or proved that [defendant], besides any income from Nail Line B.V., had private assets or income to provide for her maintenance. It is not clear how the money flows between the company and the deceased, the company and [defendant], respectively, have gone and how the costs for the joint household have been paid. For the time being, the court sees no reason to classify (part of) the joint household costs as gifts. This may be different if it turns out that [defendant] - contrary to what she claims - did indeed receive a reasonable salary for her work in Nail Line B.V. In that case it is up to her to demonstrate that she has paid a real contribution to the costs of the joint household. Available financial data of Nail Line B.V. (exhibit 16 at summons) do not provide any insight into this. The court will therefore assess the expert who will investigate the value of the shares of Nail Line B.V. also submit the question to check which salary [defendant] by Nail Line B.V. has been granted and to what extent it has a claim against Nail Line B.V.

4.54.
The question to the expert thus becomes:

what do you think is the most appropriate measure for the valuation of the shares of the deceased in Nail Line B.V.?

based on that measure, what is the value of those shares on July 4, 2013?

what was the value of the 125 shares in Nail Line B.V. in 2007 that testator then sold to [defendant]?

what salary is [defendant] by Nail Line B.V. awarded?

to what extent does [defendant] still have a claim against Nail Line B.V. in connection with any salary arrears?

what other comments would you like to make that could be of interest to the judge in settling the dispute?

IV. The issue of the bequest and the contribution

4.55.
[defendant], in her capacity as executor, has issued the bequest granted to her on June 8, 2017, without at the same time complying with the obligation to contribute opposite. For the latter, the court refers to the passage in the notarial deed of the bequest of June 8, 2017, included under V of the deed and reproduced above under point 2.14. [defendant] has argued that she has assumed all debts of the estate and that she would have fulfilled her obligation to contribute.

4.56.
The court cannot accept this statement. Not only does the text of the notarial deed say otherwise, it was also clear to [defendant] that, at the time the goods were issued, there was no agreement between the parties regarding the extent of its obligation to contribute.

[defendant] has not substantiated her statement either. It has not demonstrated that and which debts of the estate and / or the associated obligations such as interest payment and repayment have actually been paid. In addition, a legally valid assumption of debts requires that the relevant creditors have agreed to this. [defendant] has not demonstrated that either. [defendant] also ignores the fact that the statement of assets presented to each other by the parties shows that in both view the value of the assets of the estate exceeds the amount of the debts. If [the defendant] had fully complied with her obligation to submit a contribution, there would have to be a positive balance in the name of the estate. That is nowhere to be seen and it cannot be reconciled with the appeal that [defendant] has made to the payment scheme as included in the will.

4.57.
The question is whether this should have the effect of reversing the issue of the goods, at least to the extent necessary to pay the debts as referred to in Section 4: 7 of the Dutch Civil Code, as [the claimant] has demanded. The question is what interest this serves. Revoking the issue of the bequest does not change the bequest itself: [defendant] will continue to have the right to issue the goods at, in principle, the value on the day of death, albeit after the creditors of the estate referred to in Article 4: 7 under a to m and under f BW have been paid. Undoing does justice in particular to the interests of the estate's creditors and restores their redress to the extent that it has been affected by the issue of the bequest. The regulation provided for in Sections 4: 216 and 4: 220 of the Dutch Civil Code only gives the liquidator or creditors of the estate higher rank than the legatee, the power of recovery and recourse against the legatee. Finally, the court points out that pursuant to Article 4: 120 paragraph 4, if the performance has already been provided and the bequest has been issued, the legal basis thereof will be maintained, subject to the possibility of recovery and recourse as referred to in Articles 4: 216 and 4: 220 BW. This indicates that an heir who wants to reduce a bequest resting on him under Section 4: 120 (2) cannot undo a bequest once issued and that [plaintiff] only when it is established that he has a claim as a legitimate on the estate, he can take recourse as referred to in Article 4: 220 BW.

4.58.
However, the interest of [claimant] in his claim for reversal lies, in particular, as his lawyer stated in the comparative proceedings, in that he has certainty that the (other) creditors of the estate are paid and that he is not liable because of his joint and several liability as heir is sued by the creditors of the estate for his inheritance. When it is established that [defendant], as she has stated, has taken over all (underlining court) creditors from the estate and if his own debts have been paid or paid, this interest has been met and the question arises to what extent [plaintiff ] has an interest in an assessment of this part of its claims. The court will therefore give [defendant] the opportunity to submit documents showing that it has taken over the debts of the estate and has paid it at its own expense and risk and / or will pay in the future that the creditors with this debt takeover have agreed and that they are prepared to release [plaintiff] from his joint and several liability. For the sake of clarity, the court notes that this applies in any case to all not yet fully paid creditors of the estate. This also applies to debts that the court has not yet discussed above.

V. Account and accountability (claim under XVIII)

4.59.
The court can be brief about this claim: it is the legal task of every executor to give an account and account at the end of his management. This claim will therefore be granted in the final judgment.

Interim conclusion

4.60.
The court will appoint experts to determine the value of the real estate (see 4.21.), The shares (see 4.22.), The household effects and the jewelery (see 4.31.), To assess the tax claim (see 4.47 ) and the salary of [defendant] / her claim against Nail Line BV (see 4.52). An expert report is also ordered on the value of the shares in Nail Line B.V. transferred by the deceased to [defendant]. (see 4.50.)

4.61.
Before proceeding to do so, the court will give the parties the opportunity to comment on the desirability of an expert report, on the number and specialism of the expert (s) to be appointed and on the information to be submitted to the expert (s). ask. The court is of the opinion that in principle one expert is sufficient for the various sub-studies. If the parties wish to comment on the person of the expert (s) to be appointed, they must indicate which expert (s) they agree on, or against whom they object. The court will refer the case to the role for this purpose.

4.62.
In the circumstances of the proceedings, the court sees reason to divide the advances on the costs of the experts equally between the parties. Parties will therefore each have to pay half of the advances.

4.63.
[Claimant] may express himself by deed about what he has found in the administration of the deceased and what consequences this has for his claims (4.24.1., 4.24.2., 4.24.3. and 4.40.)

4.64.
[defendant] must:

- furnish rebuttal evidence against the presumably plausible existence of term life insurance (see 4.34.);

- provide proof of the existence of a loan of [name of creditor 1] and [name of creditor 2] to the deceased with an amount of € 65,042.99 (see 4.43.);

- by deed the in 4.38. and 4.39. jeopardize said loan agreements;

- bring documents before the court by document that it has assumed all the debts of the estate, whereby the remaining creditors expressly declare that they agree to the assumption of debt and do not hold [claimant] jointly and severally liable for those debts (see 4.58).

4.65.
The decision regarding all other claims and disputes will be reserved.

Finally

4.66.
This is an interim verdict, with which neither party will have really made any progress, knowing that they will be litigating against each other for a long time to come, and that pulling the bottom stone will lead to costs, which will most likely be substantial. The court therefore once again suggests that the parties consult each other and settle the matter among themselves.
