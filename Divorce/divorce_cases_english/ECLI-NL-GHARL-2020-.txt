2 Facts
3.1
The appeal is based on the following facts.

3.2
Mr [C] (hereinafter: [C]) was married to [D] (hereinafter: [D]) from [---] 1990 to [---] 1994. [C] and [D] entered into a divorce settlement in view of their divorce. In article 5 of the covenant, they have agreed the following with regard to pension rights:

â€œSettlement of the pension rights accrued by the man at Stichting Bedrijfspensioenfonds voor de Beroepsvervoer over de Weg is effected by means of a settlement, based on the present value, as stated in a letter from the aforementioned Pension Fund dated 9 November, of which a copy of this agreement is attached. On the basis of this settlement, the man will pay the woman an amount of f. 356.- "

3.3
From [---] 1996 to [---] 2003, [C] was married to [defendant]. On the latter date, the marriage was converted into a registered partnership. This registered partnership ended on September 4, 2003.

[C] and [respondent] have entered into an agreement regarding the termination of the registered partnership. In Article 6 of that agreement, they have agreed the following with regard to the pension:

"Parties expressly waive any form of pension equalization or pension settlement."

3.4
[In] 2004 [C] married [appellant]. The marriage ended in the death of [C] [in] 2019.

3 Scope of Dispute
4.1
[appellant] has made the same claims at first instance as in appeal, as stated above in 2.3. [defendant] has not appeared in court or court proceedings. She was absent from office.

4.2
In the contested judgment, the court dismissed [appellant's] claims and ordered her to pay the costs of the proceedings.

4 Reasons of the Decision
5.1
[appellant] appealed with four complaints.

Ground 1 relates to the opinion of the court that the claim seems unfounded. Ground 2 relates to the opinion of the court that no special circumstances have been put forward on the basis of which the [defendant's] default results in a wrongful act against [appellant] and ground 3 against the court's judgment that there is no unjust enrichment. Ground 4 relates to the costs of proceedings. The court will assess the complaints below.

5.2
In the first complaint, [appellant] takes the view - in summary - that the court, now that [respondent] had not appeared, should have upheld [appellant's] claim instead of dismissing the claim because the court claimed was unfounded. occurred. According to [appellant], the starting point should be by default that the claim is granted and rejection is the exception. [appellant] is of the opinion that she has substantiated her claim extensively and that [defendant] has not put forward any defense, the court could not have considered that the claim seemed unfounded to her.

5.3
Article 139 of the Rv provides that if the defendant does not appear in the proceedings on the first or on a roll date specified by the court, or fails to file a lawyer or, if owed, the court fee does not pay in time, even though he was summoned to do so and the prescribed period and formalities have been complied with, the judge will default on him and grant the claim, unless it appears to him to be unlawful or unfounded. The legislature wanted to express by the phrase "unless it seems to him to be unlawful or unfounded" that the court dismisses the claim or an additional claim if it cannot be awarded according to law (the facts stated cannot lead to the intended legal effect or for other reasons do not allow the assignment of the claim) or because the facts - even after any further information or evidence - are so unlikely that they cannot bear the claim. The judge is authorized to test the claim both in terms of the application of law and that of the factual findings. With regard to the summary assessment basis, the judge has great freedom on this point, although he cannot establish statutory limitation periods or res judicata. He is - and also in default cases - obliged to apply ex officio law of public order and mandatory law.

5.4
The court will discuss grievances 2 and 3 together.

In summary, [appellant] claims that [C] assumed that he had adequately arranged the pension, including the survivor's pension, in Article 6 of the termination agreement between [C] and [retired person]. The intention was that [respondents] and [C] would renounce the old age pension and the partner's pension. In 2019, it turned out that with regard to an arrangement for the survivor's pension, there should be an explicit statement in the agreement, or the person entitled to the survivor's pension, in this case [respondent], should sign a waiver before the arrangement could be administered. [C] subsequently wrote to both [D] and [respondent] asking them to sign a waiver. [D] signed that waiver. [defendant] refuses to sign that waiver. In view of the intention of Article 6 of the termination agreement, according to [appellant], there is a shortcoming in the fulfillment of the obligation on the part of [defendant]. This shortcoming causes damage to [appellant], because [the respondent] collects the survivor's pension while she has agreed with [C] that she would explicitly waive any form of pension. There is a causal link between the attributable shortcoming and the damage [appellant] suffers: the survivor's pension is not paid to [appellant].

5.5
The Court of Appeal first of all states that the provisions of the Pension and Savings Funds Act (PSW) that apply at the time apply to what [respondent] and [C] have agreed on pension rights in the termination agreement. Article 8a paragraph 2 of the PSW stipulates that if the marriage of a former participant ends through divorce or dissolution after legal separation, the former spouse will receive such a non-contributory entitlement to a widow's or widower's pension as the former participant for the benefit of that former spouse upon termination of the participation. Article 8a paragraph 3 of the PSW stipulates that the provisions of paragraph 2 do not apply if the husband and wife agree otherwise on marital conditions or in a written agreement with a view to the divorce. The agreement is only valid if a statement from the (pension) fund is attached to the agreement that it is prepared to cover a pension risk arising from that deviation.

Insofar as [respondent] and [C] had already agreed that [respondent] would waive her entitlements to the survivor's pension, it has not been stated, nor has it been shown that such a statement by the pension fund is attached to the termination agreement, so that there is no question of a legally valid agreement between [defendant] and [C]. The grievances already fail on this ground.

5.6
The court also notes the following.

Waiver of rights is a legal act. This requires a will and explanation aimed at legal effect. It should also be established in principle that the rightholder had knowledge of the right or jurisdiction. It cannot be inferred from the mere fact that Article 6 of the termination agreement states that [respondents] and [C] refrain from pension equalization or set-off that [respondents] had the will at the time of entering into the agreement. want to do away with her rights to a survivor's pension. Also not in connection with the fact that [D], the first wife of [C], did sign the waiver. After all, it appears from the divorce settlement of [D] and [C] that the pensions have been settled. That is fundamentally different from waiving the right to a survivor's pension.

If and insofar as [appellant] intended to state that at the time of entering into the termination agreement, the [respondent] had the will to waive her right to a survivor's pension, she has not substantiated that claim.

5.7
Complaint 4 relates to the costs incurred against [appellant]. Now that the court has ruled against [appellant], [appellant] must be ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings under Article 237 DCCP. The complaint fails.

5 Decision
6.1
The grievances fail. The contested judgment will be ratified.

6.2
As the unsuccessful party, the court will order [appellant] to pay the costs of the appeal. The costs of the appeal proceedings on the part of [defendant] will be set at nil.

7 The decision
The court of appeal on appeal:

ratifies the judgment of the court of Gelderland, seat Zutphen, of 2 August 2019;

orders [appellant] to pay the costs of the appeal, up to this judgment on the part of [defendant] set at nil.
