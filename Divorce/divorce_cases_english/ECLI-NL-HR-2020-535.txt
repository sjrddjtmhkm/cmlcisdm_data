1 Proceedings

For the course of the proceedings in factual bodies, the Supreme Court refers to:

the decisions in the case CUR201702138 of the court of first instance of Curaçao of 10 April 2018 and 7 September 2018;

the decision in case CUR201702138 and CUR2018H00354 of the Common Court of Justice of Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten and of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba of 2 April 2019.

The woman has appealed against the decision of the court. The cassation appeal is attached to this decision and forms part thereof.

The man did not file a statement of defense.

The Opinion of Advocate General M.L.C.C. Lückers seeks to annul the decision of 2 April 2019 and to refer it back.

2 Facts
2.1
The following can be assumed in cassation.

(i) The woman and the man married on July 10, 2005.

(ii) No children were born out of marriage.

(iii) The court has delivered the divorce filed for by the woman. The divorce decision was entered in the registers of civil status on October 8, 2018.

2.2
Insofar as this is important in cassation, this case concerns a request by the woman to set the contribution to be paid by the man in the cost of her living at NAf 3,000 per month.

2.3
The court has set the contribution to be paid by the man to the woman in the cost of her living at NAf 2,200 per month.

2.4
The court has sentenced the man to pay the woman monthly wages of NAf 1,250 as living allowance, starting 1 May 2019, starting 1 May 2019, and determined the contribution up to 1 May 2019 on what the man paid or has been recovered from him. To this end, the court has, as far as relevant in cassation, considered as follows:

“3.5. Now that the husband has not appealed against the amounts of the man's monthly burdens and the woman's needs budgeted by the GEA, the Court will assume this in the present proceedings.

3.6.
It is not disputed that the man receives a pension and AOV benefit of an average NAf 1,487 in total. Furthermore, it is no longer (any longer) disputed that the man works for the owner of [A], who is a good friend of his. At the hearing, the man stated on appeal that his activities consist of bringing and collecting bags to number offices of [A]. (…) The Court will hold that the man receives NAf 1,500 for this work.

(…)

3.8.
It is not disputed between the parties that the company [B] was a healthy company until 2017. The man has stated that [B] is 25 years old and has been involved in it all along. [B] was closed by the man as of October 2018. According to the man, the company had large debts as a result of the woman's actions. At the end of 2017 she had ordered a large amount of products from her sister's company, [party 1]. In January 2018, she took (a large part of) these products from the store and brought them to her sister's house, according to the man.

3.9.
By judgment of October 29, 2018, the GEA rejected the man's claims as insufficiently substantiated and ordered [B] to pay [person 1] for this order from the end of 2017. Pending the proceedings, on October 15, 2018, the man assets of [B] transferred to a third party. In summary judgment of February 5, 2019, given the size of the trading stock and the transferred inventory and the average monthly turnover figures for the previous years, the GEA questioned the amount of the sales price of NAf 20,000.00 and, partly in Taking into account that the purchase price was paid in cash, it was considered that it is sufficiently plausible that the man deliberately emptied [B] in order to damage [person involved 1] in her remedies in case [person involved 1] wins the pending proceedings.

3.10.
In view of the above, the Court sees no reason to follow the man in his unsubstantiated assertion that [B] was not viable due to the size of the debts. The Court holds that, because of his conflict with the woman, the man has deliberately ordered it to be declared bankrupt by [B]. Be that as it may, the man stated on appeal that after the closure of [B], he continued producing and selling incense products for himself. In view of the experience of the man in the incense trade, the turnover figures of [B] submitted and the statement, not disputed by the man, of the woman in the plea at first instance that she had an income of NAf 1,900 net per month on paper. enjoyed at [B], but had sufficient financial space to pay her monthly costs of NAf 6,200.00, the Court considers it plausible that the man will continue to earn a non-negligible income from these activities. The Court will estimate this income at NAf 800.

3.11.
Based on the above, the man's net disposable income will be estimated at the total of the aforementioned amounts of NAf 3,787.

3.12.
In considering all the circumstances of the case, the Court considers that a contribution from the man to the woman of NAf 1,250.00 per month is in accordance with the legal standards. Now that the woman has turned [B] into a thriving business, she should be able to start a thriving business, with or without her sister, and support herself. The Court does not consider her age or lack of education, unlike the GEA, to be an obstacle. In the above, as well as in the age of the man, the Court sees reason to limit the contribution to be paid by the man in time to five years. The contribution until May 1, 2019 will be determined on what the man has paid or recovered from him. ”

3 Reasons of the Decision
3.1.1
Part 1 of the plea complains, among other things (in paragraph 6), that the court (in legal ground 3.12) has wrongly seen reason to limit the contribution to be paid by the man in time to five years, which restriction has also had repercussions in the operative part of the contested decision. The court has ignored that none of the parties on the basis of art. 1: 157 paragraph 3 BW of the Netherlands Antilles (hereinafter: BWNA) has requested a limitation of the duration of the maintenance contribution, while the court does not have the power to officially limit the maintenance contribution with regard to the duration, according to the complaint.

3.1.2
This complaint is effective. Art. 1: 157 paragraph 3, first sentence, BWNA (in accordance with Article 1: 157 paragraph 3, first sentence, BW), grants the judge the power to grant the benefit “at the request of one of the spouses” by determining conditions and of a term. However, it is not apparent from the documents in the proceedings that the woman or the man requested that the maintenance fee be fixed. The court's decision in par. 3.12 to limit the contribution to be paid by the man in time to five years and the corresponding part of the dictum are therefore contrary to art. 1: 157 paragraph 3 BWNA.

3.2.1
Part 2 complains about the decision of the court (in legal ground 3.11) that the man's net disposable income must be estimated at NAf 3,787. According to the part, this decision is incomprehensible insofar as this amount of NAf 3,787 is based on the budget by the court (in ground 3.10) of the income that the man derives from activities relating to the continuation of the production and sale of frankincense products after the closure of his company [B] at NAf 800, -. After all, the Court of Appeal attaches significance (in ground 3.10) to the woman's statement, not contested by the husband, in the plea at first instance that she enjoyed an income on paper at [B] of NAf 1,900 per month, but sufficient financial had room to pay her monthly costs of NAf 6,200. Based on this, the court, like the court, should rather have assumed a monthly income of the man of NAf 1,900 instead of NAf 800, according to the complaint.

3.2.2
This complaint is also well-founded. The court has not clarified on the basis of which facts and circumstances the income of the man should be estimated at NAf 800 per month, based on the statement of the woman not disputed by the man about her income at [B]. and the financial space it enjoyed in that regard.

3.3
The other complaints of the product do not require treatment.
