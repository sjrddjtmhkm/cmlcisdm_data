3.25
The parties agree that the reference date for the settlement under the prenuptial agreement should be the date of filing of the petition for divorce, which is 9 January 2017.

3 Scope of Dispute
4.1
The contested decision stipulates, insofar as it is currently relevant, that the husband must pay the woman as a contribution towards the costs of care and upbringing of [child B] € 239 per month, from the date of dissolution of marriage. Furthermore, it is stipulated that the husband must pay the woman € 1,093 per month as a living allowance, with effect from the date of dissolution of the marriage. The decision with regard to the settlement of the prenuptial agreement was held pro forma until 12 September 2018. The court also determined that an appeal may be lodged against the contested decision with regard to the decision on the settlement of the prenuptial agreement.

4.2
In principal appeal, the man requests, with annulment of the contested decision to the extent that, with regard to child and partner maintenance:

- the man to the woman must pay € 53 per month until 1 June 2019 as a contribution towards the costs of care and upbringing of [child B] and from 1 June 2019 € 35 per month, or an amount that the court deems correct and that is less than € 239 per month;

- the man does not owe a contribution to the woman as a living allowance, or to determine an amount that the court deems correct and that is less than € 1,093;

- the woman must repay to the man what she received in excess of child and / or spousal maintenance as a result of the above change within four weeks after the date of this decision;

and with regard to settlement:

- declare primarily the law that it follows from reasonableness and fairness, in light of the nature and size, that the available capital is not presumed to have been formed from what should have been settled;

- in the alternative, declare that the husband has a claim against the wife of € 460,566 on compensation rights, or an amount that the Court of Appeal deems correct;

- in the further alternative, in the context of the settlement of the household costs, to stipulate that the wife must reimburse the husband € 460,566 or an amount that the Court of Appeal deems correct.

The man requests, after changing his request, regarding simple community (s) and household settlements:

- to regard the elements mentioned (as understood by the court) in section 68 of the appeal as divided and settled, in such a way that the assets reported on the side of the woman have been allocated to the woman and the assets on the side of the man have been allocated to the woman. man, as well as the listed debts are for the account and risk of the person under whose or whose name they are listed and to determine that the woman still has to reimburse the man € 27,798, plus a token item (to be calculated on the basis of the productions still to be challenged by the woman, whereby in the absence of one or more of the requested productions, the woman owes an amount of € 25,000 to the man for the total memorandum items. amount calculated in the meantime as a result of a fine for alternative damage due to failure to comply with Article 21 of the Dutch Civil Code, or in both cases an amount to be determined or to be determined by the Court of Appeal and in addition g of € 1,045.43.

The man requests, after changing his request, to determine with regard to the proceeds that the woman still has to pay the man an amount of € 10,890.72.

4.3
In principle, the woman requests that the man be declared inadmissible in his appeal, or that his appeal be dismissed as unfounded and that the contested decision be upheld to that extent, and that the man be ordered to pay the costs of the appeal. In “supplement petition defense also incidental appeal of the woman”, the woman has requested that the man claimed in respect of “other” assets and settlement “forgotten” assets, and to declare that the husband is obliged to pay an amount to pay the woman € 2,361.13 or such an amount as the Court of Appeal deems appropriate.

In a cross-appeal, the woman requests the annulment of the contested decision insofar as it ruled that an average profit from an enterprise of € 38,468 should be assumed and, again to the contrary, that an average profit from an enterprise should be assumed. company for the years 2015 to 2017 of € 49,231 per year.

By “supplement petition defense also occasional appeal by the woman”, the woman also requested that the decision be annulled insofar as a partner alimony of € 1,093 gross per month has been established based on an operating profit of € 38,468.38 per year and to re-establish a spousal maintenance allowance of € 1,616 gross per month based on a profit from an enterprise of € 49,231 per year, or at least to determine such a maintenance contribution as the Court of Appeal considers correct, but at least an amount of € 1,093 gross per month.

4.4
In incidental appeals, the husband requests the woman to be declared inadmissible in her claims, or at least to reject them, with the woman being ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings. Insofar as the woman has supplemented her request, the husband argues that the woman submitted the supplement too late: there is no obvious mistake and under Articles 359 to 361 jo 278 Rv, it understands court, the request regarding spousal maintenance in the incidental appeal must be submitted. He also concludes that the supplement petitum defense should be rejected as an incidental appeal by the woman.

4 Reasons of the Decision
5.1
The man contested the contested decision with seventeen complaints. The woman has put forward one complaint.

The man's first complaint is against the court's consideration that [Child A] and [Child B] would not have exercised their right to be heard. The man points out that both children were heard under the interim relief procedure and [child A] also under the main proceedings.

According to settled case-law, 'complaints' must be regarded as: all grounds that an appellant puts forward to substantiate that the judgment appealed against should be overturned. Since this man's complaint does not have this meaning, this complaint needs no further discussion.

5.2
The grievances 2 to 9 of the man relate to the decisions regarding child and partner maintenance. The woman's complaint in incidental appeal concerns the profit from the company calculated by the court over the years 2015 to 2017. The parties are divided between the needs of the children, the need and need of the woman and the capacity of each of the parties. . It is not in dispute that before the commencement date the date of dissolution of the marriage, April 6, 2018 must be assumed. In addition, the parties agree that the man received € 2,573 in child-related budget in 2018 and the woman € 3,697 , -.

Insofar as amounts are mentioned below, the court has always rounded these, unless stated otherwise.

Need of the children

5.3
The court has considered that there is no longer a dispute between the parties that the children's need amounts to € 654 per child per month, based on a net disposable income (NBI) of the parties at the time of € 5,573 per month. Indexed to 2018, the need is € 664 per child per month.

In summary, the man argues that although the average profit from the company for the years 2014 to 2016 was rightly assumed, the correct regime with regard to the tax deductions for business tax allowances was not taken into account. In 2014, the man had no deductions, in 2015 the man was entitled to € 12,000 starter allowance for disability and € 2,833 SME profit exemption and in 2016 € 8,000 starter allowance for disability and € 3,938 as SME profit exemption. However, the man cannot claim a self-employed person's allowance, because (due to his incapacity for work) he does not meet the hour criterion. The average profit from business operations is € 30,762 and the average deductible item is € 8,923. With regard to the year 2016, the man points out that he repaid an amount of € 30,218 from the profit on the debt to his parents of (at that time) € 44,218, so that the parties actually lived from the disability benefit received and the woman's income from paid employment. The man is of the opinion that when calculating the NBI, 1/3 of this repayment per year should be taken into account, so that there is an NBI of € 4,752.

In addition, the man argues that the need must also take into account the costs incurred by the parties for their two other children at the time of their separation. At that time, [J] was educated and lived at home (which is still the case today) and [child E] did live in rooms, but was regularly at home on weekends.

5.4
The woman points out that the man at the first instance hearing agreed to an NBI of € 5,573 per month. At the appeal hearing, it stated that it agreed to a substantive handling of the complaint. The woman is of the opinion that the court correctly based the average profit from business over the years 2015 to 2017. The eldest two children have their own income and can, in principle, provide for themselves. If it appears that they need financial support, the parties will have to determine a contribution to this by mutual agreement.

5.5
Since the woman has agreed to a substantive treatment of the complaint regarding the needs of the children, the court will reassess it. To determine the needs of the children, the court assumes that the NBI was available to the parties for their divorce and on that basis determine the need on the basis of the Nibud tables.

NBI of the man

5.6
Because the parties have based their calculations on the NBI on the man's average profits over three years, the court will follow them. Unlike the woman, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that the average for the years 2014 to 2016 should be used, since the parties split up in early 2017. That the profit in 2014 was lower because the man was working from an occupational disability situation, the court does not consider sufficient, as the woman argues, to disregard that year when averaging, because the background of resources is that lean years are compensated for by better years. In addition, the disability benefit received by the man is also taken into account. When calculating the NBI, the court will take into account the tax rates for 2016. In accordance with the IB 2014 declaration, the court assumes for the year 2014 an amount of € 17,263 (“result of other activities”). There is no dispute between the parties that the profit from the company in 2015 amounted to € 32,231 and in 2016

€ 46,087. The average profit from business operations is € 31,860. The parties agree that in 2016 an amount of € 30,000 was paid from the profit from the company to the father of the man for (partial) repayment of a loan. The man has argued that 1/3 of this amount should be deducted from the NBI because the parties actually lived out of the man's disability benefits and the woman's earnings from work in 2016 and the man's earnings from the business almost directly went to the parents. Now that it is not in dispute that the parties were unable to dispose of the amount of € 30,000 in 2016, the court will deduct € 10,000 from the net annual income. The Court of Appeal will further take into account the amounts - which are not disputed by the woman - for the start-up deduction and SME profit exemption of € 8,923 in total. In addition, the court takes into account the disability benefit received by the man of € 25,497 per year. The above leads to an NBI on the man's side of € 2,489 per month.

NBI of the woman

5.7
There is no dispute between the parties that for the calculation of the NBI of the woman, her income should be taken as shown in the 2016 annual statement, which is a gross income of € 31,067. This leads to an NBI of € 2,229 per month. The court assumes that the NBI of € 2,264 per month calculated by the man is based on a mistake, caused by the fact that the man has assumed an income on the side of the woman of € 31,607 per year.

Calculation requirement

5.8
The total NBI is € 4,718 per month. The man has argued that four children should be used to determine the need, although [J] and [child E] were of age at the time of the divorce: [J] lived (as now) at home and follows an MBO- education and [child E] lives alone, but comes home during the weekend and follows a college education. The woman believes that [J] and [child E] are able to support themselves.

At the hearing, both parties informed that the costs for [J] were largely paid by the parties. According to the woman, [child E] received a salary and partly student finance and paid for her education and books herself. The man has not contested this. Under these circumstances, when determining the needs of [child A] and [child B], the court will take into account three children, since the costs of [J] were also paid from the family income. In that case, the requirement is € 1,367 for three children, € 456 per child per month. Indexed to 2018, the need is € 472 per child per month.

Capacity of the parties

5.9
The court must then calculate the capacity of each of the parties.

Carrying capacity of the man

5.10
For the man's ability to pay, the Court of Appeal assumes the average profit from business for the years 2015 to 2017. During the appeal hearing, the parties have agreed to a profit from business for 2017 of € 37,086 as the starting point. However, the woman argues that a higher profit from business should be assumed, because the man has added extra costs in 2017 that should not be taken into account. The court agrees with the court that there is no reason to adjust the figures for 2017. The court makes the considerations of the court its own on this point. The woman has not stated, at least insufficiently, on what grounds the court's opinion is incorrect.

Unlike the man, the court will not take into account a reservation for the costs of asbestos removal or a pension provision, since it has not been alleged or proved that the man actually makes or will incur these costs. Nor is there any reason to moderate the earning capacity or the capacity of the man, regardless of whether the court assumes a different earning capacity than the current one of the woman: the court takes into account the real income of the man, since he has been able to acquire it.

The above implies that in 2017 the court of appeal assumes a profit from an enterprise of € 37,086, so that the average profit from an enterprise is € 38,468. In 2017, the man will also receive an invalidity benefit of € 25,497 per year. Taking into account the SME exemption and the child-related budget, the NBI of the man is € 3,937 per month. According to the 2018 formula of 70% [NBI - (0.3 x NBI + 920)], the available capacity of the man as of April 6, 2018 is € 1,285 per month.

From 1 July 2019, the man can no longer claim a child-related budget because [child A] [in] 2019 turned 18 years old. From that date, the NBI of the man is € 3,533 per month and his financial capacity (based on the 70% [NBI - (0.3 x NBI + 950)]] applicable formula in 2019) € 1,066 per month.

Carrying capacity of the woman

5.11
According to the 2018 annual statement, the taxable wages of women are € 34,913. Taking into account the child-related budget, she has an NBI of € 2,482 per month.

The man states that the woman should assume a higher earning capacity. Although the woman claims that she could no longer work in connection with the children, she spends her free time on her new partner and vacations, the man said. In healthcare and education, people are eager for staff. The woman disputes that she could work more. She works as a Weekend, Evening and Night head nurse, two days a week in which the children are with her and four days the other week. If she had to work 80%, she would be away four evenings every week, because in her current position it is not possible to work during the day. In addition, there is no vacancy. If she would work as a nurse in a department, in which case she could work during the day, she would fall back in salary and would end up with the same salary as now.

5.12
The court will assume the current income of the woman of € 34,913 gross per year. Apart from the question whether it is desirable for the woman to be away four evenings a week, given the age of [child B], she has undisputedly stated that there is currently no possibility within the hospital to continue in her current position. go to work.

In view of the above, the available standing capacity of the woman, according to the 2018 carrying capacity formula of 70% [NBI - (0.3 x NBI + 920)], will be € 572 per month from 6 April 2018.

5.13
The total capacity of the parties in the period from April 6, 2018 to July 1, 2019 is € 1,857 per month. This is higher than the needs of the children (€ 944 per month in total), so that the court will make a capacity comparison. The share of the man is ([1285: 1857] x 944 =) € 653 per month (€ 326.50 per child per month), the share of the woman is ([572: 1857] x 944 =) € € 291 per month (€ 145.50 per child per month).

The care discount must be deducted from the man's calculated share. It is not in dispute that this amounts to 35% of the need, therefore € 165 per child per month.

The above means that the husband has to pay a child contribution of € 161.50 per month to the woman on behalf of [child B].

As of July 1, 2019, the total capacity of the parties is € 1,638 per month. The indexed needs of the children amount to € 963 per month in total. The ability-to-pay equation results in that the share of the man ([1066: 1638] x 963 =) amounts to € 627 per month (€ 313.50 per child per month) and the share of the woman ([572: 1638] x 963 =) € 336 (168, - per child per month. Taking into account the care discount of € 169, - the husband must pay the woman an amount of € 144.50 per month for [child B]. .

Partner maintenance

5.14
The husband has argued that in judging the woman's list of needs, the court wrongly considered the rental charge of € 900 per month stated by her to be reasonable, given the amount of the rent of the house of the woman's neighbors. (€ 601.44 per month). He also considers the amount of € 1,792 per month for additional needs calculated by the court to be incorrect: the woman can work more and therefore has an increased earning capacity, while the costs of four must also be taken into account when calculating the need. children instead of two and with the payment of the debt to the man's father from the result of the man's company. He further disputes that he is able to pay a contribution of € 1,093 per month.

The woman disputes the statements of the husband and has in turn requested that the spousal maintenance be set at € 1,616 gross per month based on an operating profit of € 49,231 per year.

Admissibility request woman

5.15
The husband objected to the wife's multiplication of the request, given the time when it was made. He also points out that the woman at first instance requested a contribution of € 1,380 per month, alternatively € 1,071 per month.

The Court of Appeal held that, according to settled case law of the Supreme Court (cf. HR 20 March 2009, ECLI: NL: HR: 2009: BG9917), the nature of a dispute such as the present one justifies an exception to the rule that the judge does not consider should refer to grievances and changes or additions to appeals lodged after the appeal or the incidental appeal, which means that the appeal judge may take into account facts on which the woman only formulates after formulating appeals to her, even if nothing else than a new complaint can be seen therein. After all, the scope of a maintenance obligation, such as that at issue, can always be changed or withdrawn by a later court decision, even retroactively, if it ceases to meet the legal standards by changing the circumstances. It is therefore in both parties' interest that the determination of the maintenance obligation is based on a correct and complete valuation of the relevant circumstances at the time of the ruling in the highest resort. In addition, it has not been alleged or established that the husband's interests have been harmed by the increase in the wife's request, since the husband has had the opportunity to respond to the wife's additional request. The woman can therefore be received in her additional request.

5.16
The court has already rejected the statement by the husband that the woman has a higher earning capacity because she can work more, which the statement the husband understands to the court to argue that the woman is not needy, and also applies to spousal maintenance.

Based on the Court standard, the court has calculated the additional need of the woman at € 1,792 per month, based on an NBI in 2017 of € 5,573 per month and the costs of the children of € 1,308 per month. The parties have not grieved against the application of the Court standard. Therefore, the court will also use the Court standard. As considered under 5.8, the court assumes an NBI of € 4,718 per month and an amount of € 1,367 in costs for children is taken into account. Based on this, the woman's need equals 60% of (€ 4718 - / - 1367 =) € 3,351 = € 2,011 per month. As the court has done, the court will take into account the costs of the children insofar as these are borne by the woman, since the parties have not raised any objection to this. This concerns an amount of € 317 per month. Taking into account the woman's own income, she has an additional requirement of € 202 (gross) per month, indexed to 2018 € 209 (gross) per month.

When applying the Court standard, no assessment is made of the individual items. The man is therefore no longer interested in dealing with his complaint about the housing costs of the woman.

5.17
In determining his ability to pay, the man took into account the costs of asbestos removal and a pension provision. As the court has considered in the context of child maintenance, the court does not take these costs into account. As stated in paragraph 5.10, the Court of Appeal assumes an average profit from business of € 38,468 and disability benefit of € 25,497 per year and also takes into account the addition of notional rental value of € 2,681 (WOZ value € 383,000), a deductible mortgage interest of € 3,427 per year and the child-related budget of € 2,573 per year. In addition to the mortgage interest, the court takes into account the fixed amount for other owner's expenses, the health insurance premium of € 140 per month and the deductible of € 32 per month, which expenses are not disputed. The court also takes into account the share of the man in the costs of [child A] and [child B] of € 627 per month (including healthcare discount). Taking into account this income and expenditure, the man is able to pay an amount of € 1,156 gross per month in spousal maintenance. As of July 1, 2019, he has a carrying capacity of € 1,168 per month. The man is therefore able to meet the additional need of the woman.

The contributions determined by the court are lower than determined by the court in the contested decision. The man has paid the amounts imposed by the court and he states that the amounts paid in excess should be repaid by the woman. According to settled case law, the judge should use his power cautiously to have the change to pay a child contribution become effective on a date prior to his decision, in particular if this can have drastic consequences for the creditor in connection with a life called obligation to repay what has actually been paid in the preceding period. As long as prenuptial agreements have not been settled, the court cannot determine whether the woman will have the ability to repay the excess amounts paid, therefore the husband's request cannot be granted.

5.18
The court has attached a copy of the calculations with regard to the NBI of the parties, the needs of the woman and the capacity of the parties to this order.

Prenuptial settlement

6. The grievances ten to 17 of the man relate to the settlement of prenuptial agreements and, in short, include the following:

- the court incorrectly summarizes the position of the man in paragraph 2.6.5 (ground 10);

- the court wrongly argues that the parties must first establish what the pre-marital property of both parties was at the time of the marriage date (ground 11);

- the court wrongly considers that the man the mortgage registration of f. Has not substantiated 750,000 (€ 340,355) (complaint 12);

- the court wrongly considers that the woman, with substantiated documents, states that on 13 May 1996 the man received an amount of f. Has deposited 140,000.00 per cash into his business deposit account (complaint 13);

- the court wrongly dismissed the man's appeal to reasonableness and fairness and subsequently wrongly determined that the value of the nursery should be included in the settlement, because the man suspects that it has undigested income (to the court understand :) are satisfied, would not have been disproved and that the value of the endowment insurance with Ohra and the value of the home should be included in the settlement because the husband would not have disproved that the endowments of the endowment insurance are not undigested income satisfied (complaint 14);

- the man did not state that he had borrowed the loan of (at that time) € 603,022 that the man had at the time from his father to the company, which he had run for several years in the form of private companies keep running; the court wrongly considered that it is not in dispute that the wife has no assets during the marriage and that it was in the husband's way to indicate per year what amounts have been used for the household, what the incomes of the man and the woman, which part was accounted for by the woman and the man, respectively, in view of the ratio of the incomes and insofar as the incomes were insufficient, the sums paid by the man and that the man thereby claim that he is entitled to half of the amount of € 680,913 has not been sufficiently substantiated; it is questionable whether the salary payments from his B.V. qualify as wealth instead of income; the court wrongly considers that the man has not made a plausible case that he can take out an amount of household costs (ground 15);

- it is wrongly stated that the more subsidiary claim of the man means that he would owe € 126,869.50 p.m. to the woman (complaint 16);

- the court wrongly considers that the parties must still consult on the distribution of the household effects (complaint 17).

The court will assess these grievances of the man below with the exception of his eleventh and twelfth complaints. The husband has no (longer) interest in his eleventh complaint, because the wife confirms the marriage proposal and it is shown under the facts (3.5).

The man's twelfth complaint is based on a misreading of the contested judgment. After all, on page 10 of this judgment, the court considers that the man stated to finance the nursery and the house that he took out a mortgage loan and that he has not substantiated this statement with documents. The court therefore does not speak of a mortgage registration. Insofar as the man also meant in his complaint to say “mortgage loan”, he has no interest in discussing this complaint now that the amount of the mortgage registration and loan he has made is shown under the above facts (legal consideration 3.7).

Complaint 14

6.1.1
In complaint 14, the man addresses the demands for reasonableness and fairness as referred to in Section 1: 141 (3) of the Dutch Civil Code against the rejection of his appeal.

The man's explanation of this complaint amounts to the following. It is established that the man has set off private assets (worth € 668,500 according to the woman) against a debt (of € 921,132) that the man and the woman owe to the parents of the man who - if not before the reference date at the man had been forgiven with the exclusion clause - would fall into the setoff. A creditor other than the man's father is said to have filed for bankruptcy in 2011 in order to be forced to sell. For this reason, it was prudent for the husband and wife to take over debt. If only the assets and liabilities on the reference date are taken into account and the repayment of this debt is not included, it would be an unjust enrichment of the woman. Thanks to the donation by the parents of the man to him, the house and nursery were still present on the reference date. Parties were obliged to establish a second mortgage right on their home, which would be flooded as a result. According to the man, it is therefore contrary to reasonableness and fairness to regard the home, the nursery and the policy as having arisen from saved income, because it was obtained indirectly by way of gift. In addition, the obligation to set off jeopardizes the continuity of the company. Due to his illness (he is 60% incapacitated for work), the man is unable to obtain new financing and in the event of set-off, he could only set off (part of) his compensation claim on the woman because she did not contribute to paying off the debt to the parents. Because of his illness, he cannot work as an employee and cannot start a new nursery for the same reason. Apart from that, a suitable nursery is unavailable and rent would disproportionately impact profit. Due to his limitations and care for the children, it is imperative that he live next to the nursery. The man has proved that the home and nursery are more than one hundred percent related to donated assets. The court understands that the man believes that, on the grounds of reasonableness and fairness, the home, nursery, policy and mortgage loan should not be settled.

The woman puts forward a motivated defense.

6.1.2
Pursuant to the provisions of Article 1: 141 paragraph 3 of the Dutch Civil Code, if at the end of the marriage a periodical settlement obligation agreed upon by marriage conditions is not met, the assets then present will be presumed to have been formed from what should have been settled, unless derives otherwise from the requirements of reasonableness and fairness in light of the nature and scope of the obligation to set off.

In their prenuptial agreement, the parties have agreed a periodical settlement clause with regard to undigested income or of what has been obtained by investing undigested income. They have not implemented the periodic settlement clause. For that reason, the assets currently present are presumed to have been formed from what should have been settled, and the periodic settlement clause has, as it were, been resolved in a final settlement clause. According to the man, relying on the requirements of reasonableness and fairness in the light of the nature and scope of the set-off obligation, it should be determined - as the court understands - that the house, nursery and policy are not suspected formed from what should have been settled because, if the debt had not been repaid, it would have been part of the assets to be settled. The man thus underlies his position facts and circumstances that could have arisen but ultimately did not materialize. In the opinion of the court, there is no place for an “if-then test” like this. On the basis of existing case law, the “unless clause” based on reasonableness and fairness is to be interpreted in a limited way and is not intended as a kind of fairness test on the result. The presumption of evidence only concerns the question whether or not the assets present at the end of the marriage were financed from what should have been settled. This also applies to the exception. This means in this case that the subsequent debts and the repayment thereof by remission or set-off from the man's private assets prior to the end of the marriage, do not play a role in the assessment of what on the reference date is to the amount to be settled. belongs. It should not be forgotten that the loans have not been taken out to acquire the home, nursery or policy, or to repay debts resting on it. Nor does the man's personal circumstances play a role. There is no room for an overall fairness test. Everything that the man has put forward in this context is contrary to the foregoing.

If the presumption of evidence is established, the parties are obliged to describe the assets to each other. Since the parties have chosen to calculate the amount to be settled per asset, the court will follow this view.

Complaint 10

6.2
Contrary to what the woman thinks, the man is receptive to his tenth complaint. The court understands this complaint as meaning that the man wishes to raise the following objections. The way in which the purchase of the plot (being the nursery and the land on which the house is built) was financed (A, see also complaint 13), the other assets (in addition to real estate, endowment insurance and mortgage debt) that must be included in the settlement are involved (B, see also what the man has stated under points 66 and 67 of the appeal), the family fund [the Family fund] (C, see also complaint 15) and the manner in which the costs of the household were paid in the period that he was not enjoying enough income from the nursery (D). In her response, the woman also occasionally appealed against the statements of the husband in this sense.

Ad A. (complaint 13)

6.3.1
In summary, the man states that he paid the purchase price on 6 June 1996 from the mortgage loan. He didn't go out on the street with that amount. ABN AMRO Bank has booked this amount as a "cash deposit" because the man would take out a loan from ABN AMRO Bank for a maximum of f. 750,000. The amount of the "cash deposit" (converted € 63,529) was borrowed in advance from the bank. The mortgage debt amounted to € 136,135 from 1999 to the end of 2016. The house was built for an amount of approximately f 336,000. The costs for the purchase of the land and the construction of the house together amounted to f. 724,109 (converted € 328,586), of which € 136,135 was borrowed from the bank. In addition, the man relies on the facts as included under 3.8 to 3.10.

The man sold pieces of parcel in 2012 and 2014 to cover living expenses and repay flexible credit.

The woman defends.

6.3.2
It has been established between the parties that in 1996 the purchase price for the nursery including the land for the house to be built f. 361,000.- in connection with the purchase of the land and the nursery f. 388,109 has been transferred to an account of the notary, including an amount of f. 140,000. It has also been established between the parties that the construction costs for the house f. Amounted to € 336,000 and the mortgage loan in any case from 1999 amounts to € 136,135. Parties do not agree whether the amount of f. 140,000 comes from saved income or from a bank loan.

During the oral hearing, the man acknowledged that he made money during the marriage and thereby bought the nursery with land and that the mortgage loan was taken out to finance the home. Based on this, complaint 13 needs no further discussion.

Ad B

Toyota, Opel and boat (66 a and b)

6.4.1
The parties agree that the value of the Toyota, Opel and the boat must be settled on the basis of Article 1: 141 paragraph 3 of the Dutch Civil Code and that the woman must pay the man a total of € 2,600.

Koopsompolis (40738423) (66 c)

6.4.2
The parties agree that the single premium policy (with number 40738423) ended on 24 June 2016 and that it should be included in the settlement. According to Exhibit 33, to which both parties refer, this is an investment insurance policy and the value (of the shares) as at 24 June 2016 was € 6,150.82. It is disputed between the parties whether the settlement should take into account a tax claim of 52% and a revision interest of 20% on the value. According to Exhibit 33, the man was invited to let him know what he would like to do with the benefit and to be informed. The man has indicated that he wants to keep the policy. It is unclear whether the man has arranged this, how and what the tax consequences (will) be. The Court of Appeal therefore considers it insufficiently informed to be able to decide on this point of dispute. The man will have to submit data to the court showing that he has continued the policy and in which the consequences he has stated are sufficiently substantiated. If he proceeds to do so, the revision interest / tax claim he has made must be taken into account and if he fails to do so, the full amount will be eligible for setoff.

Household contents (66 d)

6.4.3
The court understands that the parties agree that their joint household contents were worth € 6,000, that they are / are allocated to the man and that he must pay half of the value to the woman. It is disputed between the parties whether the household effects purchased by the woman at the end of 2016 for an amount of € 600 should be included in the settlement.

The woman does not dispute that this purchased household goods is / is allocated to her and that it cannot be assigned a value of € 600.

The court ignores the position of the woman that the household effects purchased by her are not part of the assets to be settled / distributed. It is established that the reference date is January 9, 2017, that the purchased household goods have been paid with deductible income and that it has not been established that the woman has paid these with private income. Any excess or underpaid contribution to the costs of the household will be rectified by the settlement of the bank balances on the reference date. The total value of the household contents is then € 6,600, of which € 6,000 on the side of the man and € 600 on the side of the woman must be included in the assets to be settled, so that a settlement obligation arises of € 2,700 from man to woman.

2015 tax assessment of the man and tax refund 2015 of the woman (66 e and f)

6.4.4
According to the last page of Exhibit 10 of the change request of the woman at first instance of May 23, 2017, which is a statement of approval / authorization of November 10, 2016, the man owes income tax in 2015 for an amount of € 5,248 and for the Health Insurance Act contribution € 843. -.

According to Exhibit 4 of the preliminary request of the man at first instance, being a statement of approval / authorization of 10 November 2016, the woman is entitled to a 2015 income tax / national insurance contribution refund of € 5,056.

According to the man, settlement should still take place. According to the woman, this is not the case. In the opinion of the court, settlement should take place if and insofar as payment and / or return has taken place after the reference date of 9 January 2017. Parties must still inform each other about this on the basis of the final assessments for 2015, so that the amounts to be included in the settlement can be determined. The court cannot further decide on this point. Parties will also have to submit data to the court on this point.

Child benefit and / or bill of twice € 566.80 received on April 3 and July 3, 2017, respectively (67 a)

6.4.5
The man apparently takes the position that the received child benefit for April and July 2017 of twice € 566.80 was half for each of the parties, because the parties subsequently split the child benefit and are therefore still entitled to half of the the child benefit taken up and not distributed by the woman.

The woman agrees to set off the child benefit of 3 July 2017 because the provisional relief decision is effective as of 11 May 2017, so that she must pay € 283.40 to the man. Parties must act accordingly.

The court sees no reason to include the child benefit received in April 2017 in the settlement. The child benefit is intended to cover the costs of the children. It has not been stated or it has become apparent that the amount has not directly / indirectly benefited the children. There is then no room for settlement.

Subsequent payment KIT / KGB for 2015 (67 b)

6.4.6
The parties agree that the woman has received the supplementary payment KIT / KGB made on 10 July 2017 for the year 2015 in the amount of € 2,015. Since this additional payment relates to the period before the reference date and relates to income to be offset, the woman must pay half of this amount, being € 1,007.50, to the man. This does not alter the fact that the amount has now flowed into the household and has been used up.

Subsequent payment KIT / KGB for 2016 (67 c)

6.4.7
According to the man, the woman must provide a specification of the subsequent payments KIT / KGB for 2016. According to the woman, she did not receive any supplements with reference to production 7 submitted by her for the year 2017.

Aside from the fact that the production 7 of the woman is not legible given the small font, it is not about supplements for 2017 but about 2016. The woman must still provide the requested specification to the man.

The provisional and final assessment IB 2016 (67 d)

6.4.8
The man rightly assumes that the woman is obliged to bring into question the specifications of the provisional and final assessment IB 2016. The woman cannot suffice with reference to the bank statements 2015 and 2016. Declarations are usually made in the year following the year to which the declaration relates. The woman must submit the provisional and final assessment 2016 IB.

Settlement of balances and / or account of parties ING (67 e), bonus interest account ING of parties (67 f), ING payment account with number [account number 1] in the name of the woman (67 g), ING account [account number 2] (67 h ) and ING Growth Larger account number [account number 3] in the name of [child A] (67 i), ING Youth account [account number 4] in the name of [child B] (67 y)

6.4.9
The man states that settlement of bank balances / debts should take place as follows.

- the and / or account of the parties to ING had a balance of € 477.59 as at the reference date, so that the woman must pay half of that amount or € 238.80 (e);

- The ING Bonus account of the parties had a balance of € 2,000 on 1 January 2017 and, after transfer by the woman on 4 January 2017, of € 700 to a regular account, of € 1,300. The woman must pay half of this amount, being € 650, - to the man, because she only used this balance after the reference date (f);

- the balances as at the reference date on the ING payment account in the name of the woman with number [account number 1] and ING Bonus account with number [account number 2], with a balance at the end of 2015 of € 1,273.47 and € 1,449.68, respectively, should also be included in the settlement (g);

- of the balance on the ING Growth Larger account number [account number 3] in the name of [child A] of € 1,819.93, the parties would pay the costs of [child A] after secondary school. The man recently had to pay € 881.65 from his private account, because after the reference date the woman had € 250, € 900, € 600, € 70.37 and € 200, respectively, so a total of € Has taken up 2,020.37 euros for its own use. The woman thereby demonstrated that the money was intended for the parties, so that she must reimburse € 909.97 (h);

- the woman has parked amounts in the ING Youth account of [child B]. Parties have half of this balance. The woman must reimburse € 2,500, half of € 5,000 (i).

The woman defends.

Ad e and f

As the man states, the balances of the and / or account of parties to ING and the ING Bonus interest account of parties to ING as of the reference date, 9 January 2017, must be included in the final statement. The woman should pay the man half of € 477.59, therefore € 238.80. It does not alter the fact that the woman spent the full amount on the costs of the children after the reference date. The woman must also pay half of € 1,300, or € 650, to the man. That, as the woman argues, the husband would claim set-off of an amount of € 700, is based on a wrong reading of the husband's statement.

Ad g

The balances of the bank accounts in the name of the woman also apply, as the man wishes, to be included in the final statement. The fact that the amounts that were on the account on the reference date stated by the man were completely spent on the costs of the household does not mean that on the reference date the balance of these accounts was nil. The woman must provide access to the balances as of the reference date.

Ad h

The bank account mentioned under h concerns an account in the name of [child A]. The wife does not dispute the statement of the husband that the parties had agreed that they would pay the costs of [child A] after secondary school from this account, nor the statement of the husband that she had withdrawn all amounts for her own use. However, the court sees no reason to grant this claim of the man. Since this was an account in the name of [child A], the Court of Appeal assumes that the money in the account belonged to [child A] and does not belong to the amount to be settled, and that the parties should only have it with authorization. of the subdistrict court on the basis of 1: 253k BW in connection with Article 1: 345 BW.

Ad i

According to the appendices to exhibitions 18 on appeal submitted by the man, in November 2016 an amount of € 5,000 was transferred from the and / or account of parties with number [account number 1] to the ING youth account in the name of [child B] . This account of [child B] included an amount of € 5,256.76 on 1 and 9 January 2017. The woman acknowledges having transferred money to the children's account. She does not contradict the statements of the man that she transferred € 5,000 to the account of [child B] and then € 4,000 to her private account. In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, it has thus been established that the woman has parked € 5,000 of the parties' accounts and that this was still present on the reference date, 9 January 2017, so that this amount belongs to the amount to be settled. This does not alter the fact that the woman subsequently spent this. She must pay € 2,500 to the man. The fact that the woman appropriated a higher amount from the account of [child B] that originally belonged to the parties, as the man understands to the court, argues in his “response to the supplement to the petition for defense, also incidental appeal of the woman, also containing apparent recovery. petition of the man ”of May 13, 2019, cannot be deduced from the submitted productions.

Debt to the man's parents (67 y)

6.4.10
According to the man, the settlement should include a debt to the parents of the man of € 14,000, plus interest of € 420, with reference to the income tax return 2017.

According to exhibit 40 at first instance, being the 2017 draft declaration, there was a debt to [the father] of € 14,228. According to the woman, this is a business loan from the husband's father to his company, which amount would have been canceled at a later date. The woman was not a debtor for this debt, so settlement of this debt is not an issue.

The court rules as follows. The aforementioned amount plus interest must be included in the settlement, in view of what is considered below under 6.5. The man has a right to compensation insofar as he has borne more than half.

Tax assessment of the man over 2016 (67 k)

6.4.11
According to the man, the woman of the tax assessment for 2016 should pay half of € 13,317 and € 1,877, being € 6,658 and € 938.50. According to the woman, this is an attack that relates to the man's business, which cannot be set off against the woman. The court does not follow the woman's position. The man has a personal business and profits from it from business. The ensuing obligations for income tax and national insurance contributions must be taken into account in the amount to be settled on the basis of Article 1: 141 paragraph 3 of the Dutch Civil Code. Now that the woman does not contest the amounts herself, the woman must pay € 6,658 and € 938.50 respectively.

Flexible credit with ABN AMRO Bank (67 l)

6.4.12
According to the man, the flexible credit at ABN AMRO Bank should be included in the settlement at the reference date, amounting to € 5,000. The woman does not agree with this, because, as she argues, the credit is in the name of the man, he took the amount on 31 December (understands the court) 2016, stating private payment and it is unclear where these funds are spent.

The court considers as follows. For settlement on the basis of Article 1: 141 paragraph 3 of the Dutch Civil Code, it does not determine whether an asset is only registered in the name of one person. It is also not necessary to establish whether it has been proven what the funds were spent on. In view of this, the flexible credit must be included in the final statements and the woman must pay € 2,500 to the man.

Funeral funeral insurance at Ardanta (67 m)

6.4.13
According to the man, the woman should reimburse him for half of the value on the reference date of her funeral capital insurance. According to the woman, this concerns risk insurance with reference to her production (as the court understands) 8 on appeal.

The production 8 to which the woman refers concerns an insurance overview with contract number: 0080091077, the policyholder of which is Ms [Z], the mother of the woman and in which an overview is given of the policies that fall under the contract number, with always stated respectively on whose name and for what amount the insurance applies from 1 January 2019.

The man has not further substantiated on what basis this insurance should be included in the final settlement. In view of the fact that not the woman, but her mother is the policyholder of the policy, the court will dismiss his claim on this point.

Woman's claim against her mother (67 n)

6.4.14
On the basis of the production 21 submitted by the man on appeal, the woman declares that she is willing to meet the man half of (7 x NLG 520 =) NLG 1,820, being converted EUR 825.88.

6.4.15
From the foregoing it follows that the man's sixteenth (p.m. claim of € 126,869) and seventeenth complaint (household effects) are partly successful and that they need no further discussion.

Ad C family fund [the Family Fund], loans and reimbursement rights (complaint 15)

6.5.1
The man claims to have a compensation right to the woman. In support of his statements - insofar as relevant here - he puts forward the following. The man's father (hereinafter: the father) lent € 550,000 to [B.V.1]. The husband and wife jointly took over this claim from the father on [B.V.1] (see 3.12), as a result of which they jointly received a claim on [B.V.1]. Subsequently, the parties jointly borrowed € 165,000 from the father (see 3.14), so that the debt at the end of 2007 amounted to € 715,000 and in 2008 again together € 80,000, so that they owed the father € 795,000. . Subsequently, the man was forgiven € 47,117 and the debt as of 1 July 2009 was € 761,753. Subsequently, on July 23, 2009 and July 26, 2010, € 25,000 was borrowed again and the amount was increased by the interest owed, so that the debt on June 30, 2010 amounted to € 843,223, and subsequently an amount of € 25,000 was remitted ( see 3.15). Subsequently, the parties owed an amount of € 28,702 in interest on May 30, 2011 and borrowed € 50,000 and € 25,000 on March 7, 2011 and May 10, 2012 (see 3.16).

On 25 May 2011, the woman emailed Actan on her own initiative and asked for an explanation of the structure of the loan, which explanation was given (see 3.18). After the man fell ill in 2011, the man's parents (hereinafter: the parents) no longer charged interest. The parents have successively made waivers (see 3.19 to 3.22).

In total, the parents waived € 921,132 on or settled with a debt of the parties.

In the alternative, the husband (in the event that both the home and the nursery and the policy with Ohra would fall under the assets to be settled) had a claim on the woman of € 460,566 because he presented a debt to be borne by both of them. a larger part than concerns him has been redeemed, so that the rights of the creditor towards the woman as co-debtor under this subrogation for this surplus transfers to the man and in addition under Article 1:87 BW, because it is charged to the man's property a debt relating to the woman's property has been paid and finally on the basis of applicable case law.

In the further alternative, he claims to have a right of compensation for paying the costs of the household.

6.5.2
The woman defends. Among other things, she argues the following. She considers it unlikely that the man's father would lend her money. The father could only borrow these funds because he had assets in a family fund. Money from the family fund was never intended to benefit the woman. The woman is not included in the agreement of 30 May 2011 (see 3.16) as a co-debtor. Only the man is included there as the borrower and the father with his wife as the lender. Moreover, under h, it is stated in the preamble that the present agreement supersedes everything previously agreed by the parties with regard to the loans. In that deed, the woman only signed for a positive / negative mortgage statement to be issued by her. She further argues that, as evidenced by the deed of 2 June 2008, the amount of € 80,000 was transferred by means of a deposit into the bank account of [B.V.2].

She disputes that the man has a claim of € 460,566 from the woman under a compensation right, because no capital has been withdrawn by the woman from the assets of the man under which he would have a right to compensate her and because she has no is a co-debtor.

6.5.3
At the court are the questions whether the father's loans were granted only to the man or to the man and the woman together and, if the latter question is answered in the affirmative, to what amount it concerns a joint debt and whether the man a right of reimbursement accrues to the woman for remittances made on these loans by the father / parents and for settlements made with this loan.

Before answering these questions, the court finds that the parties agree that the parents of the man have established a family fund by notarial deed and that the participation of the man in this belongs to his private property as well as by investing it accumulated capital and that its value on 1 January 2014 was equal to € 431,824 and as of 1 January 2015 to € 455,166. If undisputed disputes at least insufficiently substantiated, it is further established that the father has lent an amount and that this amount, including interest accrued thereon, has in any case amounted to € 921,132 and that this amount has been waived in part or settled with the man's private assets ad € 458,804 from the family fund.

From what the parties have mutually argued, it appears that the man is a grower, was initially employed and then ran a business at his own expense and risk, initially with a rented nursery and then with his own nursery. The own nursery contributed man in 1998 in [B.V.1] and was transferred back to man in private by [B.V.1] in 2006. [B.V.1] bought a new nursery in 2005. For the purchase thereof by [B.V.1], the father of the man [B.V.1] borrowed an amount of € 550,000. In 2007, the entire crop of the nursery was lost as a result of the delivery of an incorrect soil mixture and from 2008 the credit crisis was tangible. The man assumed that the nursery would recover. In 2011, the man became seriously ill, as a result of which he was 100% and later 60% rejected. In 2012, both [B.V.1] and [B.V.2] were declared bankrupt, which bankruptcy was closed in 2015 due to a lack of income.

The parties received income from 2001, apparently for tax reasons, income from [BV2], the woman for the years 2001 to 2008 ranging from approximately € 18,000 to € 20,000 and the man for the years 2001 to with 2006 more than € 50,000 and later over the years 2007 to 2009 about € 30,000. In 2010 up to and including 2012, no salary was paid out by [B.V.1].

The woman entered salaried employment in 2008 and received an income of € 890.00 in 2008, approximately € 13,000.00, € 14,000.00 and € 15,000.00 in 2009 to 2011, and 2012-2015 respectively. approximately € 25,000, € 25,000, € 26,000 and € 27,000 respectively. As of 2012, the man received an occupational disability benefit of € 43,334. From 2013, the man started working again as a grower in a personal company. His income from the nursery has increased from that year, while his income from disability insurance has decreased from that year.

According to the loan agreement of 1 September 2007, the parties have taken over the debt of [B.V.1] of € 550,000 to the father of the man. In return, they have received a receivable from [B.V.1] which will be settled in current account. On the same day they also provided a credit facility to [B.V.1] up to an amount of € 525,000. According to the loan agreement of 2 June 2008 from the father in 2007 and in 2008, the parties borrowed the amounts referred to above under 3.14 of the facts. They declare that they have received the amounts borrowed in 2007 themselves and that they have received the amounts borrowed in 2008 by deposit in the bank account of [B.V.2]. From this, the court understands that both agree with the destination of these funds and that in return they must have obtained a claim on [B.V.2] (see exhibit 60 on appeal). In total, up to and including 2008 the parties borrowed € 795,000 from the father. According to a waiver agreement of December 24, 2010 (3.16), two additional loans were issued of € 25,000 each and interest on the loan was credited of € 31,470. According to a loan agreement of May 30, 2011 (3.17), the loan has been increased by interest payable in this respect in the amount of € 28,072 and two loans of € 50,000 and € 25,000 in 2011. The latter amount has been father of the man on May 10, 2011 transferred to the and / or account of both parties with the mention 'loan'. It follows that the husband has sufficiently demonstrated that the parties borrowed € 795,000 from the father together and that this amount was increased by € 31,470 and € 28,072 in 2010 and 2011 in connection with interest due thereon, so that the the total of the joint loan on 10 May 2011 amounts to € 854,542.

In addition, an amount of € 125,000 has been borrowed, of which it has been established, as stated above, that on May 10, 2011, € 25,000 was deposited in the and / or account of both parties by way of loan. The man has also made plausible that the amount of € 25,000 has been lent to both parties, so that the total amount is in any case equal to € 879,542.

In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, the man's explanation, as far as possible with supporting documents, has made it sufficiently plausible that the other funds provided by the father were also lent not only to the man but also to the woman. In contrast, she has only argued that the man is the borrower. It has not disputed the amount of the loans.

It is sufficiently clear from the above that not only that the woman was a co-debtor / borrower, but also that the woman was closely involved in the state of affairs, also actively. For example, a debt build-up (3.20) was given at her request. It is further apparent from the woman's signature of the documents that she agreed to the state of affairs. This is also understandable because, certainly at the time when the first loan was taken out, but also in the years when no salary came out from [BV1], the parties depended on the woman's salary, which was considerably less than they were used to. and they both had an interest in the survival of the company.

The woman bases her assertion that the man alone and she was not a borrower / debtor on the loan contract of 30 May 2011, because the woman is no longer listed as a borrower, she only counted in connection with the security to be provided and because under 'taking into account' under h it states that this agreement replaces all that the parties have previously agreed on money loans.

The court does not follow this position. Sufficiently follows from the above that the husband and wife borrowed (predominantly) money from the father together and are therefore both parties the borrower. It does not follow from the agreement of 30 May 2011 that the husband has taken over the wife's share of the debt to the parents. According to the woman, which she emphasized at the hearing, she signed only for the obligation to provide security included in that deed. According to the man, this is correct in that this deed was only drawn up with a view to a mortgage. According to him, later deeds / agreements were also only in his name because of the remittances. Even if, as the woman argues, it should follow from the agreement of May 30, 2011 that only the man is the debtor, there would still be an asset shift, because a debt previously incurred by both parties would only incur the man and thus a right of reimbursement may still have arisen. In that context, the Court of Appeal therefore considers of secondary importance, as the woman states, that only the man is mentioned in the annual accounts. Within the framework of the agreements made, the parties had a claim on [B.V.1] / [B.V.2] and this went up in smoke as a result of the bankruptcy.

In support of her claim, the woman also relied on the production submitted by her on appeal 17, which includes an overview of transfers in 2006, 2007 and 2008 from private to the man's company. In the light of what has been considered above, without proper explanation that is lacking, it is not possible to see to what extent this detracts from what has been considered above. In addition, the man has stated that the parties regularly parked money in a private account from the company if this cost less in connection with interest payments on the debt and that the transactions listed on this form part of a set of transactions. In the light of this statement, the woman has not sufficiently explained her claim and it would have been in her way not to suffice with a list of bank transfers.

The court also does not follow the woman in her assertion that money has been borrowed from the family fund that was directly used to make up shortages of [B.V.1]. This does not follow from production 60 to 63 of the man on appeal and is also inconsistent with the above. In exhibit 60 an explanation is given of the build-up of the debt of the company to private and follows that there was no debt in 2006, in 2007 a debt to private (mainly the conversion of the amount of € 550,000 in connection with further loans from the father to the husband and wife and how this debt accrues to private in later years.Without further explanation, which is lacking, this claim of the woman that money was borrowed from the family fund is incomprehensible.

It remains to be assessed to what extent the husband is entitled to a reimbursement right charged to the wife in the amount of the amount claimed by the husband of € 460,566. The right to reimbursement cannot be based on “subrogation” nor on article 1:87 BW. The subrogation to which the man, as the court understands, refers to a different situation and Section 1:87 of the Civil Code only refers to payment of debts associated with goods. Insofar as the man intended to appeal to recourse, he has stated too little. It has not been stated or it has become apparent that the debts have been incurred jointly and severally.

Finally, the man relies on the administration of justice. Already in its judgment of June 12, 1987 (LJN AC2558, NJ 1988, 150, in particular EAAL12, Kriek / Smit), the Supreme Court considered that it should be stated that between spouses who have excluded any community under their prenuptial agreement, compensation rights can arise because goods acquired during the marriage in the name of one have been partially or fully financed with money from the other, as is evident from articles 1:95 paragraph 2 (old), 1:96 paragraph 2 (old) and 1: 127 (old) of the Civil Code, compensation rights may also arise in a community existing between spouses. In its judgment of January 10, 1992 (LJN ZCO469, NJ 1992/651, m. Nt. EAAL, Kriek / Smit à l'inverse), the Supreme Court ruled that also in the situation that a house is registered in the name of both parties , half of which, while predominantly financed by one of the spouses, is entitled to a corresponding fee.

In this case, this concerns a debt of both parties that has been repaid by the man through a remission with the exclusion clause and subsequent settlement with private assets, to a rounded amount of € 14,000 after the full payment. In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, compensation rights can also arise in such a situation in accordance with Article 1:96 paragraph 2 (old) and Article 1:96 paragraph 4 (new) of the Dutch Civil Code. The court will therefore grant the primary request of the man up to an amount of half of the repaid part of € 907,132, which is therefore € 453,566, because the share of the woman will also be charged to the man's assets. has been repaid in debt. The more subsidiary request of the man with regard to a right to compensation with regard to the costs of the household need not be discussed.

6.6
The conclusion in principal appeal is that complaints 11 and 12 are unsuccessful, complaint 13 needs no discussion, complaints 10, 15, 16 and 17 succeed and that complaint 14 fails. The contested decision of which appeal will be annulled to that extent. With analogous application of Article 356 DCCP, the court will refer the case back to the court with regard to the settlement of the prenuptial agreement, with due consideration of what has been considered above, to further process the case. The court will also compensate the costs of the appeal proceedings, given the relationship between the parties.
