2 Facts

The court refers to the contested decision for the course of the proceedings and the decision at first instance.

In that decision, insofar as it is relevant here:

the decision of “the circuit court” of New Hampshire, the United States, of May 16, 2017, that the husband should pay the child child maintenance of USD 2,588 per month, plus 26% of the husband's income above USD 14,782.00, being the man's bonuses, as well as the decision of “the circuit court” of New Hampshire, the United States, of July 25, 2017 that the man with an amendment of the aforementioned decision to the woman as of November 1, 2017 child maintenance must pay USD 2,576 per month, plus 26% of the man's income above USD 14,782, having the man's bonuses recognized;

granted the exequatur of those decisions;

The decision has been declared enforceable with stock. The legal costs have been compensated between the parties.

The court starts from the facts established by the court, insofar as no appeal has been made against this.

3 Appeal

1. In dispute, the contribution to be paid by the husband to the wife in the costs of care and upbringing (hereinafter also: child maintenance) of the minors:

- [the minor 1], born [in] 2006 in [place of birth]

- [the minor 2], born [in] 2008 in [place of birth],

hereinafter also together: the minors.

2. The man requests the court, to the extent practicable with stock, to annul the contested order and again do justice to the child maintenance as included in the judgment of the State of New Hampshire of 16 May 2017 and 25 July 2017 (as referred to above, the decision of “The circuit court” of New Hampshire), and to provide that as of July 21, 2017, or from a court of law that understands the court: court, date of commencement reasonably determined, the contribution of the man is set at an amount of € 310 per child per month, at least at such an amount as your court, the court understands: court, judged in good justice. Costs in law.

3. The woman defends herself against this and requests the court to reject what the man in appeal requested and to ratify the contested decision and to order the man to pay the costs of the proceedings. Costs in law.

4. By letter of 25 November 2019, the man amended his request to the effect that he now requests that the contested decision be destroyed as far as practicable in stock, and again as follows:

change the child maintenance as included in the ruling of the State of New Hampshire of May 16, 2017 and July 25, 2017, and to determine that with effect from July 21, 2017, or with effect from a date to be reasonably determined by the court, the man's contribution is set at an amount of € 268 per child per month, or at least at such an amount as the court deems in good justice;

to order the woman to repay the husband received too much child support, calculated by the husband at € 58,593.26, at least at such an amount as the court deems in good justice.

Costs in law.

5. By letter of 26 November 2019, the woman states that she cannot agree to the additional / increased request from the husband so that she wishes to defend against it and she also requests that the husband's request be rejected.

Jurisdiction and applicable law
6. Now that the parties live in the Netherlands, the Dutch court has jurisdiction over the request for child maintenance and Dutch law applies to it.

Change of circumstances?
7. In short, the court has ruled that there is no question of the man-made change of circumstances that should lead to a reassessment of the child maintenance provided by the American judge.

8. The man disagrees and argues the following:

the relocation of parties and minors to the Netherlands is a relevant change in circumstances. The American judge has not anticipated the financial consequences of this and has included it in determining child maintenance. At that time it was not even sure whether and when the woman would follow the man and the children to the Netherlands;

the child maintenance provided by the American court refers only to the temporary situation that the parties had not yet settled in the Netherlands. There is now a stable situation in which both parties are permanently established in the Netherlands again. Travel and moving expenses, as well as babysitting costs taken into account by the U.S. judge, have been dropped. As a result, the needs of the children identified by that judge are no longer representative;

the husband's income has changed. He has been employed by [de B.V.] since July 24, 2017. As of that date, his basic income is significantly lower than the basic income he received in America on which child support is based.

Based on the above, according to the man, there is a change in circumstances as referred to in Article 401, paragraph 1, Book 1 of the Dutch Civil Code.

Furthermore, it follows from the man's appeal that the calculation method for maintenance in the state of New Hampshire is different from that in the Netherlands. The court understands from the man's explanation that the judge in New Hampshire has not applied the Dutch legal standards. The court refers, among other things, to marginal 30 of the man's appeal. The man states there: "Furthermore," the circuit court "has clarified that the 26%" child maintenance bonus "refers to 26% of what the man receives in addition to his basic salary, so a possible bonus." In the pleading note on the side of the man under marginal 2 it is stated: "After all, calculations have been made using the American calculation system and the American tax burden." In addition, the plea states "In New Hampshire, child maintenance is calculated according to a legally established formula, by which the joint net income of the parents is multiplied by a percentage that depends on the number of children, after which the resulting maintenance obligation is divided between the parents. in proportion to their respective incomes. "

9. The woman contradicts the statements of the husband as follows:

the American judge has determined child maintenance in the knowledge that a move of the parties and the children to the Netherlands would take place in the short term;

according to his own statements, the man's basic income as of January 1, 2018 appears to be higher than that of the American judge. This cannot lead to a reduction in child maintenance. In addition, his income in the period July 25, 2017 to December 31, 2017 was higher than the man claims since he was not taxable in the Netherlands at the time;

the American judge has taken into account a stable situation in the Netherlands by, among other things, deciding on school choice, care scheme, holiday scheme and so on;

the man could have appealed the decision of the American judge;

the man does use the American court orders where it suits him (registration of divorce, moving). However, his financial obligations form the basis for the move to the Netherlands, so that the man must also comply with it;

parties still use a babysitter. The woman has not received a moving allowance from the husband's employer, the accounts have been paid directly by this employer;

the woman still has the additional costs for transportation and accommodation, which the American judge has taken into account because she still formally works for [employer] and stays in America a week a month.

10. The court considers as follows. A core dispute between the parties is whether the move of the minors and the parents from the United States to the Netherlands is a legally relevant change of circumstances or whether the American judge has already taken this move into account in its decision to provide child maintenance. As the Court of Appeal already communicated orally at the hearing of December 6, 2019 at the request of the parties, in the view of the Court there is a legally relevant change of circumstances effective on July 21, 2017 when the minors after their move with the man are registered at his address in the Netherlands. In addition, the Court of Appeal has stated orally that, in its opinion, the American judge has used a different technical basis in determining child maintenance. The US judge has considered, “The guideline amount for financial support is $ 2588 per month. He must pay this as a basic contribution, plus 26% of any bonus contribution over and above the income of more than $ 14782 per month. ” (production 11 by letter of April 1, 2019 from the man).

The starting points of the Dutch system with regard to child maintenance are need and capacity. In determining the need, the Dutch system therefore does not assume that the amount of $ 2,588 per month for child support can be supplemented with a bonus of 26% on income that exceeds $ 14,782.

The Court of Appeal therefore considers that the American judge has used incorrect standards under Dutch law. The court will therefore assess child maintenance under Dutch law from 21 July 2017

Minors need
11. The court further considers as follows. As already considered above, during the oral hearing, the Court of Appeal gave the parties a definite answer as to whether there was a change in circumstances or not. The court did this in the hope that the parties could reach an agreement by mutual agreement in the interest of the minors. Unfortunately, however, it has become apparent that the positions of the parties have become so hardened that mutual settlement is not an option. In the view of the court, the conflict between parties is partly fueled by the excessive amounts that are charged with regard to the costs of the minors. The Court of Appeal is well aware of the Supreme Court's judgment of 4 December 2015, ECLI: NL: HR: 2015: 3479, in which the Supreme Court explicitly indicated that the level of prosperity during the needs of the minors should be considered the marriage of parties. Before moving to the Netherlands, parties were resident in the United States, where the man had a top position with correspondingly high income and high expense allowances. In the United States, according to the court, parties lived as expats, which generally means that the cost of living and the costs of minors are very high. Because of the move to the Netherlands, there is no longer any question of life as expat children for minors. The court has established that the minors attend a normal Dutch school, attend a normal Dutch hockey club, and so on. The move to the Netherlands therefore also has consequences for the needs of the minors, now that they are no longer expat children and they lead a different life than when they lived in the United States. In view of this, the court will assess the needs of the minors according to Dutch standards, taking into account the wealth in which the family lived, but no longer with the wealth of an expat family.

12. At the hearing, it was argued at the hearing that the joint need of the minors should be determined on the basis of the standard amounts corresponding to the maximum net family income of € 6,000 net per month as included in the needs table, namely € 1,440 ,- per month. In addition, the man submitted a "Provisional Statement of Child Costs" at the hearing. This cost overview corresponds to the cost overview that the woman brought into question in a letter dated 26 November 2019. During the oral hearing, the Court of Appeal discussed both cost statements in full with the parties. The parties agreed on a limited number of costs. It concerns the following costs (completed by the court):

Subscriptions

€ 7 per month per child.

Memberships

€ 5 per month per child.

Not reimbursed medical expenses

€ 5 per month per child.

Sailing camp / summer camp

€ 25 per month per child.

Allowance

€ 12 per month per child

However, with regard to most costs, there was a difference of opinion and understanding between the parties.

13. In the aforementioned overview that the man has provided, the man has indicated per subject what his vision is with regard to the costs of the minors and what those costs are in the vision of the woman. The court is now proceeding to discuss the main points of dispute regarding the needs of the minors.

14. A point of dispute between the parties is the postal service concerned. Both parties have a significant income, although the income of the man is higher than that of the woman. The income of both parties is so high that, even if they would only rent or buy a house for themselves, it would be such that the two minors can always stay in the house. That the man moved to an expensive villa in [place of residence of man] is his choice, and the woman's choice to purchase a rental home of € 2,364 per month is also her own choice. This suits their income and lifestyle. In view of what the Court of Appeal has considered for this, the Court therefore does not consider it reasonable in this specific case to attribute part of the housing costs component to the needs of the minors. The court therefore does not take into account the item Housing.

15. A second major cost item with regard to minors is the Holidays and trips. The woman arrives at an amount of € 717 per month for both minors. As a cost for Holidays and trips, the man takes an amount of € 300 per month for both minors. In her 'Preliminary overview of child costs', the woman explained the costs of Holidays and trips as follows: once a year to the United States for € 3,600, once a summer holiday for € 2,000 and once a ski holiday for € 2,000. In view of the motivated dispute by the man, the court is of the opinion that these (high) costs are insufficiently substantiated. The children now live in the Netherlands and that they go on holiday to the United States every year is at most a personal choice of the parents. The court considers plausible that the minors go on holiday and that it is appropriate given the status and fortune in which the children live. The court therefore reasonably estimates these costs at € 300 per month per child.

16. Another major point of dispute between the parties is the position of Babysitter. The woman raises an amount of € 495 per month. The man is of the opinion that, considering the income of the parties, they can both bear the costs of the babysitter themselves. The court considers as follows. By letter of December 5, 2019, the woman informed the court that she has a gross annual income of € 81,406 in 2018. The man has a gross income of € 265,060 in 2018. In view of these incomes, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that in determining the needs of the children, no babysitting costs need to be taken into account, which must then be divided between the parties, because the parties can amply pay possible babysitting costs from this income. In addition, the court also considers that one week the children are with the man and the other week with the woman. The court therefore does not take into account the babysitting costs stated by the woman in this specific case. The Babysitter item can also be offset with other expenses.

17. The other points of dispute (where the court rounds off to whole numbers) are:

Phone

The woman has not included any costs for this item. According to the man € 25 per month per child.

School / study costs

According to the woman € 58 per month per child. According to the man, € 45 per month per child

Transport

According to the woman € 62 per month per child. According to the man, € 50 per month per child.

School trip

The woman has not included any costs for this item. According to the man € 2.50 per month per child.

Dress shoes

According to the woman € 100 per month per child. According to the man, € 75 per month per child.

Inventory

According to the woman € 25 per month per child. According to the man € 13 per month per child.

Sport

According to the woman € 149 per month per child. According to the man, € 125 per month per child.

Dutch class

According to the woman € 60 per month per child. The man has not included any costs for this item.

Nutrition

According to the woman € 163 per month per child. According to the man € 200 per month per child.

Personal care and cleaning supplies

According to the woman € 20 per month per child. According to the man, € 10 per month per child.

Pets

According to the woman € 43 per month per child. According to the man € 25 per month per child.

Therapy

According to the woman € 50 per child per month. The man has not included any costs for this item.

Entertainment / gifts / children's parties

According to the woman € 38 per month per child. According to the man € 25 per month per child.

18. The court considers as follows. Given the incomes of the parties, the court considers the differences to be marginal. After hearing the parties at the hearing, the court reasonably estimates the costs as follows:

Phone

€ 25 per month per child for the uncontested mobile phone subscriptions of the minors.

School / study costs

€ 45 per month per child.

Transport

€ 50 per month per child.

School trip

€ 3 per month per child.

Dress shoes

€ 100 per month per child.

Inventory

€ 15 per month per child.

Sport

€ 125 per month per child.

Nutrition

€ 200 per month per child.

Personal care and cleaning supplies

€ 10 per month per child.

Pets\

€ 25 per month per child.

Entertainment / gifts / children's parties

€ 25 per month per child.

19. The court does not take into account the items Dutch lessons and Therapy. It has not been demonstrated that the costs for Dutch lessons are necessary and have a structural character. With regard to the costs of therapy, the Court of Appeal assumes that these are, in principle, reimbursed by the health insurer if there is a medical need and that they are not of a structural nature either.

20. The above leads to a need of € 977 per month per child, or € 1,954 for the minors together. Now that both parties still deduct the child benefit from - as the court understands - € 97.33 per month per child - to this amount, the court will do the same, as the parties have agreed on this. The court therefore determines the need of the minors at a rounded € 880 per month per child / € 1,760 per month for both minors together.

Distribution of the costs of the children.
21. As has been considered above, the parties have such a high income that the full application of the Treme Report is also inappropriate with regard to the calculation of the parents' share of the children's costs. It is important that the net disposable income of the woman cannot be calculated exactly because she does not know all the data regarding her tax burden. For the calculation of the net disposable income, the ability to pay and the distribution of the costs of the children, the court must therefore connect to those data that are established as much as possible and that may give rise to as little discussion as possible. The Court of Appeal also considers it important that a sustainable solution is found that should prevent parties from always having to go to court to find a solution. It is a well-known fact that children suffer from legal proceedings in which they are directly or indirectly involved. In order to arrive at a sustainable solution, the Court of Appeal has chosen in this specific case to calculate only the net disposable income (also: NBI) of the parties, which implies that the Court will stop assessing the carrying capacity calculations at item 121. The the parties' net disposable income thus forms the basis on which the children's costs are distributed. During the oral hearing, the parties agreed to this approach.

4 Reasons of the Decision
22. The court considers as follows. In a letter of 25 November 2019, the man stated what his gross income is and what his capacity is per period with regard to the calculation of his ability to pay per period. The periods indicated by the man are:

period I: from 21 July 2017 to 31 December 2017

period II: from 1 January 2018 to 30 April 2019 and

period III: from 1 May 2019.

Furthermore, by the aforementioned letter as Exhibit 24, the man has challenged his ability to pay calculations for the aforementioned periods.

23. By email of 4 December 2019, the Court of Appeal requested financial documents from the woman regarding her ability to pay. The documents requested by the Court of Appeal included the 2018 Income Tax return, as well as a capacity calculation. In addition, it is the responsibility of the woman to bring into question all those financial data that are relevant to the woman's ability to pay, even if the court has not specifically requested those documents. The woman knew then that the capacity of the parties would be discussed in full during the oral hearing. By letter of December 5, 2019 (before the session of December 6, 2019), the court received only a means of capacity calculation and some information regarding the woman's income. This letter and the oral hearing showed that the woman is a taxpayer in both the Netherlands and the United States. Since the exact income data as well as data regarding the tax burden are missing, the court can only come to an estimate of the income and an estimate of the tax burden, which was already communicated orally to the woman's lawyer at the hearing and that she also had the consent. from the man's lawyer.

It follows from the letter of 5 December 2019 from the woman's lawyer that the woman has a gross income of € 81,406 in 2018. The woman has calculated her net disposable income at an amount of € 52,010 per year. At the hearing, the woman indicated that she also had the aforementioned income in 2017 and 2019. She also indicated in the aforementioned letter that her tax burden will increase in 2019 as the 183-day rule (a tax facility) no longer applies. The court repeats once again that, due to the lack of concrete data, it is only possible to estimate the net income of the woman.

24. At the hearing, the court explicitly asked parties about the net disposable income (NBI) with regard to the years 2017, 2018 and 2019.

25. The man's lawyer has indicated that the man's NBI in:

2017 € 11,058 per month

2018 € 12,967 per month and in

2019 € 13,642 per month

amounts.

26. As the woman's NBI, the woman's lawyer stated:

2017 € 52,000 per year

2018 € 52,010 per year

2019 € 42,010 per year.

Regarding the NBI in 2019, the woman's attorney comes to a lower amount than in previous years as the tax burden on the woman would increase as stated in her letter of December 5, 2019.

27. The Court of Appeal subsequently proposed appointing an expert for the calculation of the NBI of the parties. However, both lawyers have indicated that they do not consider this desirable. The court will therefore estimate the NBI of the parties on the basis of the information available to the court. The court finds the NBI of the man as indicated by his lawyer sufficiently substantiated and will adopt that. With regard to the NBI of the woman, the court will assume the amounts indicated by the woman's lawyer, with the exception of 2019, as it has insufficiently substantiated the effect of the tax burden on that income that it has stated. The court therefore assumes in all three periods an NBI of the woman of € 52,000 per year / € 4,333 per month. The court considers the difference of € 10 in the years 2017 and 2018 to be marginal.

28. The court establishes the man's share of the children's costs in proportion to the parties' net disposable income as the NBI of the man divided by the NBI of the parties jointly multiplied by the monthly need per child.

29. In the period from July 21, 2017 to December 31, 2017, the joint net income of the parties amounts to 11,058 + 4,333 = € 15,391 per month. This means that the share of the man in the costs of the children during this period is 11,058 / 15,391 x 880 = € 632 per month per child. The woman's share is therefore € 248 per month per child.

30. In the period from 1 January 2018 to 30 April 2019, the joint net income of the parties amounts to 12,967 + 4,333 = € 17,300 per month. This means that the share of the man in the costs of the children during this period is 12,967 / 17,300 x 880 = € 660 per month per child. The woman's share is therefore € 220 per month per child.

31. As of 1 May 2019, the joint net income of the parties amounts to 13,642 + 4,333 = € 17,975 per month. This means that as of 1 May 2019, the share of the man in the costs of the children is 13,642 / 17,975 x 2,612 = € 668 per month per child. The share of the woman's costs is therefore € 212 per month per child.

32. It is common ground that the children spend one week with the man and the other stay with the woman. Both assume a care discount of 35%. Now that both parties assume this, the court will follow parties in this. This implies that the care discount for men is 35% x 880 (the need per month per child) = € 308 per month per child.

33. The husband must therefore meet the wife with regard to the costs of care and education of minors:

- from July 21, 2017 to December 31, 2017: 632 - 308 = € 324 per month per child

- from 1 January 2018 to 30 April 2019: 660 - 308 = € 352 per month per child

- from 1 May 2019: 668 - 308 = € 360 per month per child.

Refund
34. The man has demanded repayment of the overpaid child maintenance. The man calculated the amount to be refunded by letter of 25 November 2019. The husband has requested that the wife should pay him the sum of € 58,593.26. By letter of November 26, 2019, the woman raised a global defense. It has not specifically disputed the claim calculated by the man, either in terms of amounts or in the method of calculation. Nor has it substantiated with financial data that it is unable to repay the overpaid amount. In any event, given the extensive debate that has taken place between the parties with regard to child maintenance, it would have been up to the woman to explain in concrete terms why she cannot repay. In addition, the woman could have been expected to have gone into exactly the calculation method, since it was brought to the court by letter of 25 November 2019 and was sent to the woman's lawyer. In other words, the woman knew exactly what it was about. It is established that the woman has a substantial income and the court has also shown that the woman has already received amounts from the man in the context of the division. It follows from the pleading note from the man that the woman received an amount of $ 98,000. The woman has not contested that she has received this amount. The woman has also not given a specification to the court whether she spent this amount. Financially, the woman is therefore able to repay the amount claimed.

35. As the Court has already considered above, there is a serious conflict between the man and the woman. It is in the interest of both parties, but also in the interest of the children, that the fight, including the lawsuits that the woman has brought against the man in the United States, come to an end.

36. It follows from the petition of the man that the court may also reasonably determine what the woman must repay. Now that the woman has not contested the amounts paid, the court estimates the amount that the woman must repay to the man reasonably at € 25,000. The court has reasonably determined the amount to be repaid, partly in view of the woman's income and expenditure and to prevent the case from escalating further.

Litigation costs

37. In view of the family law nature of the present case, the Court will compensate the legal costs of the appeal proceedings in the sense that each party will bear its own costs. The parties' requests to the contrary will be rejected.

38. The decision is therefore made as follows.
