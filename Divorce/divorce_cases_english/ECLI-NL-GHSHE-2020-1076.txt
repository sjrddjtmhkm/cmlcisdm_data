3 Scope of Dispute
3.1.
The dispute concerns the answer to the following questions:

I. Have interested parties made the required declaration?

II. Did [testator] live in the Netherlands in 2013?

3.2.
The inspector concludes to confirm the statement of objection. Interested parties conclude that the court's decision is confirmed.

4 Reasons of the Decision
With regard to the dispute

I. Required declaration

4.1.
The inspector takes the position that the burden of proof should be reversed and increased, because stakeholders have not made the required declaration. Interested parties have not submitted the tax returns for resident taxpayers issued to them, although they have been invited, reminded and warned to do so. According to the inspector, the submitted IB / PVV 2013 declaration for non-resident taxpayers is no different. As a result, interested parties have not fulfilled their declaration obligation.

4.2.
Stakeholders argue that they have indeed made the required declaration. To support their position, they refer to the aforementioned declaration.

4.3.
In order to answer the question whether interested parties have filed the required declaration, it is necessary to determine whether [testator] lived in the Netherlands, using the normal rules of the obligation to provide and the burden of proof. The Court of Appeal is of the opinion that this is not the case and refers to the considerations about the domicile of [testator] below. In such a case, it cannot be objected to interested parties that they have not filed a declaration for a resident taxpayer, since they have correctly submitted a declaration for a non-resident taxpayer.

4.4.
In the event that the IB / PVV 2013 declaration has to be taken into account, the inspector alternatively takes the view that interested parties have filed a declaration of a tax due that is absolutely and relatively too low.

4.5.
For the reversal and increase of the burden of proof to occur because the tax due according to the declaration, both in itself and proportionally, is considerably lower than the actual tax due, it is required that interested parties have been aware or should have been aware that the declaration is substantively defective used to be. The knowledge and insight of the third parties engaged by interested parties is attributed to them. The inspector has the obligation to pose and the burden of proof of this. The court is of the opinion that the inspector has failed in this. The difference between the tax owed according to the declaration and the actual tax owed, based on a foreign tax liability, would be caused by the number of homes that should be included in the yield basis, the degree of entitlement to those homes and the value attached to the homes. must be granted. The fact that interested parties were aware of these defects in the declaration at the time of the declaration was not stated by the inspector, nor has it been shown. There is no question of reversing and increasing the burden of proof.

II. The residence

4.6.
The question of where a person lives must be assessed according to the circumstances under Article 4 of the General Law on State Taxes. It is important whether the circumstances are such that a lasting bond of a personal nature exists between [testator] and the Netherlands. This lasting bond need not be stronger than the bond with any other country, so that it is not necessary for a residence in the Netherlands that the center of someone's social life is in the Netherlands. It follows from the parliamentary history of the tax residence concept that the legislator did not want to attach special significance to certain (categories of) circumstances, such as, for example, a person's social or economic connection with a country.

4.7.
The inspector takes the position that [testator] lived in the Netherlands in 2013. The burden of proof with regard to the facts and circumstances from which the correctness of this position follows, rests with the inspector.

4.8.
In support of his position, the inspector referred, among other things, to the fact that [testator] and [the wife] were registered in the Netherlands in the Personal Records Database, to the real estate held in the Netherlands, the presence of family members, medical treatment in the Netherlands and to the expenditure made in the Netherlands.

4.9.
Stakeholders contested the inspector's claims with reasons. For example, stakeholders made a timeline of the whereabouts and travel movements of [testator] in 2013. From that timeframe it follows that [actual testator's stay in the Netherlands was not extensive. The inspector also confirmed this at the hearing of the court. The correctness of the time frame has not been disputed by the inspector (for lack of knowledge). With regard to registration in the Netherlands in the Personal Records Database, interested parties have substantiated that this registration is related to taking out health insurance in the Netherlands. Interested parties stated during the appeal hearing that [testator] occasionally came to the Netherlands about once a year to go through his file with a Dutch doctor, to draw up a treatment plan and possibly to undergo a few investigations. The duration of the stay depended on the number of examinations and the period for waiting for the results of those examinations. The further implementation of those treatments took place in Kenya. The fact that [testator] has made use of medical care in Kenya has been substantiated by stakeholders. Incidentally, [testator] was treated for melanoma in 2012 in London (United Kingdom).

Interested parties have further argued that the registration in the Personal Records Database and the statement to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (IND) are related to the fact that [the wife] wished to obtain a residence permit in the Netherlands. That statement is substantiated with reference to a letter from [the wife's lawyer] of 20 February 2013.

With regard to the real estate in the Netherlands that [testator] had at his disposal, interested parties have argued that the real estate was largely acquired within the family, namely from an inheritance. The real estate was never used for active asset management and management was outsourced by [testator] to an asset manager. With regard to the bank balances held, it was stated by interested parties that [testator] preferred to keep most of his assets in the Netherlands, because he did not find Kenya a suitable place for this.

[testator] had family in the Netherlands. For example, stakeholders, the brothers of [testator], lived in the Netherlands. In addition, a daughter also lived in the Netherlands, who was even registered for some time at the same address as [testator]. Interested parties referred in this regard to the residence of two other close relatives, namely another brother and sister. The other brother stayed in Zambia and Kenya, the sister alternately stayed in Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Kenya. During the appeal hearing, interested parties stated that they were often only informed afterwards about the visits of [testator] to the Netherlands. Furthermore, it has been stated that [testator] had no connection with his daughter. The daughter's registration was related to obtaining a study grant and contact with [testator] about this was done through interested parties. Those statements made by interested parties have not been contested by the inspector.

Account statements have been submitted by the inspector. These account statements show that [testator] rented a car from Greenwheels several times. During the appeal hearing, the inspector also stated that he no longer takes the position that [testator] had a car to his name in the Netherlands. The other depreciation is mainly related to subscriptions, fixed costs and maintenance work performed. The inspector has referred to payments in Bruges, but these have been explained by stakeholders with reference to the journey made through Europe. The payment in [place 2] was made at Schiphol. What is completely missing in the account statements provided are payments related to the basic necessities of life. There are no expenditures for groceries, association memberships or other leisure activities. The account statements therefore do not indicate a lasting link of a personal nature with the Netherlands. The inspector has argued that [testator] had several bank accounts and it is therefore possible that this expenditure was made through other accounts. However, it is up to the inspector to investigate that. The inspector did not do this.

4.10.
In view of the provisions under 4.9, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that the inspector has not complied with the burden of proof on him. Against the reasoned dispute by interested parties, the inspector has failed to demonstrate the facts and circumstances mentioned by him or the facts and circumstances should not be given the weight advocated by the inspector. Therefore, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that [testator] did not have a lasting personal relationship with the Netherlands in 2013.

Interim conclusion

4.11.
The appeal is unfounded and the court's decision must be confirmed.

Regarding court registry fees

4.12.
The registrar levies a court registry fee of € 519 on the inspector, because the court confirms the court's decision.

Regarding the legal costs

4.13.
The court orders the inspector to reimburse the costs that interested parties reasonably had to incur in connection with the handling of the appeal to the court, because the appeal brought by the inspector is unfounded.

4.14.
This is based on 3 related cases in which interested parties have been wholly or partially in the right. This concerns the present case in the name of [interested party], number 19/00298, the case in the name of [person 1], number 19/00324 and the case in the name of [person 2], number 19/00325.

4.15.
The court sets this allowance at 2 (points) x € 525 (value per point) x 1 (factor weight of the case) x 1 (coherence) is € 1,050.

4.16.
Interested parties did not request any further procedural costs reimbursement.

4.17.
In each of the aforementioned cases, the court will award a procedural expense allowance of (total amount: number of cases =) € 350.
