Ruling of the Second Multiple Tax Chamber

to the appeal of

[X] in [Z] (hereinafter: interested party)

against the decision of the court [E] of 17 September 2018, numbers AWB 18/1698 and AWB 18/1868, in the dispute between the interested party and

the inspector of the Tax and Customs Administration / Arnhem Office (hereinafter: the Inspector)

1 Proceedings
1.1.
For the year 2015, the Inspector imposed an assessment in income tax / national insurance contributions (hereinafter: IB / PVV) on a taxable income from work and home of € 27,966 and a taxable income from savings and investments of € 81. charged € 118 in tax interest by decision. For 2016, the Inspector imposed an assessment in the IB / PVV on the taxable person on taxable income from work and home of € 29,151. An interest of € 35 in tax interest has been calculated. In addition, the Inspector has decided by decision not to award a penalty.

1.2.
With separate judgments on objections, the Inspector declared the objection to the 2015 IB / PVV assessment to be well-founded, reduced the taxable income from work and home to € 26,956, maintained the taxable income from savings and investments and reduced the tax rate accordingly. The Inspector has also declared unfounded the objection to the IB / PVV 2016 assessment and the tax interest decision, as well as to the periodic penalty payment order, in separate decisions on objections.

1.3.
The interested party appealed against these decisions to the District Court [E] (hereinafter: the District Court). The Court has dismissed the appeals regarding the IB / PVV assessments for the years 2015 and 2016 as unfounded. The Court has not taken a decision on the appeal concerning the periodic penalty order.

1.4.
The interested party appealed against the decision of the District Court.

1.5.
The investigation at the hearing took place on 21 January 2020. An official report has been drawn up of the hearing and is attached to this ruling.

2 Facts
2.1.
The interested party was married to Ms [A] from 26 March 2007 (hereafter: the ex-partner). The ex-partner filed for divorce on November 30, 2016.

Regarding the 2015 IB / PVV assessment

2.2.
On 13 March 2016, the interested party filed a declaration for IB / PVV for 2015, requesting the deduction of expenses for specific healthcare costs and gifts. The interested party and his ex-partner have been designated as tax partners. By letter of January 12, 2017, the Inspector asked for more information about these deductible items. By letters of 13 January 2017, 9 March 2017 and 9 June 2017, the interested party provided the Inspector with information about the expenditure of specific healthcare costs and the donations and adjusted the amounts initially stated in the declaration for the specific healthcare costs on parts. Ultimately, the interested party has requested for the year 2015 to deduct the following expenses for specific healthcare costs and gifts (for application of thresholds):

Concerning the penalty payment order

2.8
On 16 November 2017, the Inspector received the notice of objection from the interested party against the IB / PVV 2015 and 2016 assessments.

2.9
The interested party has given the Inspector notice of default on 5 February 2018 for not making a decision on the interested party's objection to the assessments referred to in 2.8.

2.10
In separate letters dated 19 February 2018, the Inspector gave reasons for the objections submitted by the interested party against the IB / PVV 2015 and 2016 assessments. In the preamble of the letters, you will find “ruling on the notice of objection”. Furthermore, this letter states - insofar as relevant - the following:

“(…)

Assessment of your objection

(…)

Decision

I partially meet your objection.

It is possible to appeal against the decision on the notice of objection. I refer you to the explanation on the assessment notice that you will receive shortly.

(…) ”

2.11
On 22 February 2018, the Inspector decided by decision that the interested party is not entitled to a penalty because the Inspector has made a decision on an objection within two weeks after receipt of the notice of default.

2.12
On 7 March 2018, the interested party received a letter from the Inspector for the year 2015 with the caption “decision on objection”, which includes a numerical elaboration of the previous letter of 19 February 2018. The Inspector also mentioned a remedy reference in the letter.

2.13
The Inspector declared the objection to the penalty payment order on 3 April 2018 to be unfounded by decision on the objection.

3 Scope of Dispute
It is in dispute whether the interested party is entitled to a penalty payment for failure to timely decide on the objections against the IB / PVV assessments for 2015 and 2016. In addition, it is in dispute whether and to what amount the interested party is entitled to deduct expenses for specific healthcare costs and gifts. With regard to the specific healthcare costs, the interested party has appealed against the dietary costs (2015) and costs for clothing and bedding (2015), as well as the transport costs (2016). In addition, it is still disputed whether the Inspector has violated the due care principle or any other principle of good administration and whether the interested party is entitled to compensation for non-material damage. The Inspector abandoned his position on internal compensation.

4 Reasons of the Decision
Periodic penalty payments

4.1.
Pursuant to Section 4:17 (1) of the General Administrative Law Act (hereinafter: Awb), if a decision on application is not made in time, the administrative body forfeits the applicant a penalty for each day that it is in default. Pursuant to Section 4:17 (3) of the Awb, the first day on which the penalty payment is due is the day on which two weeks have passed after the date on which the decision-making period has expired and the administrative body of the applicant has has received written notice of default.

4.2.
The Awb term, as well as the other terms within which an administrative body has to take decisions, protect citizens against improper government behavior and also provide legal certainty, because citizens thus know within which term they will receive clarity about the government's position (cf. Parliamentary Papers II 2004/05, 29 934, No. 3, p. 1).

4.3.
A written notice from the inspector to the interested party is to be considered as the decision on the objection made by that interested party if that notice makes it clear that the inspector has decided on the objection and that the objection phase has thus come to an end (Supreme Court 11 October 2019, no.18 / 00689, ECLI: NL: HR: 2019: 1574).

4.4.
The Inspector received the notice of default on February 5, 2018, so that he had until February 19, 2018 to make a decision on objection before forfeiting a penalty. The Inspector, with reference to his letters of 19 February 2018, takes the position that he has taken in time. On the other hand, the interested party states that the objections of 19 February 2018 did not address all of his objections, so that the notice of default continues.

4.5.
The Court is of the opinion that the Inspector has decided on the objections of the interested party with the two separate statements of reasons for the objections of 19 February 2018 and that the objection phase has ended (HR 11 October 2019, no. 18/00689, ECLI: NL: HR: 2019: 1574). With the justifications, the Inspector has provided interested parties with legal certainty and clarity regarding the settlement of the objections. It is also clear from what is included under the heading “decision” that the objection phase has been completed. This does not alter the fact that, as the Court has not shown, it is possible that not all of the objections of the interested party were discussed. Neither does the effect under 2.12. said letter, now that the Inspector has already decided on the objection with the letter of 19 February 2018. The foregoing means that the Inspector has issued a decision on the objection within the term set out in Article 4.17 (3) of the Awb and has rightfully not awarded a penalty.

4.6.
The Court has failed to make a decision on the appeal against the periodic penalty payment order. The interested party has therefore rightly appealed against this. The appeal is therefore well-founded. The Court will then decide as the Court should have done.

Expenses for specific healthcare costs

4.7.
Article 6.1 (1) (a) of the Wet IB 2001 provides that the personal allowance is the combined amount of the personal deductible items that are taxed on the taxpayer in the calendar year. Expenses for specific healthcare costs belong to the personal deductible items.

4.8.
Article 6.17, paragraph 1, of the Wet IB 2001 (text 2015/2016) provides that expenditure for specific healthcare costs is expenditure incurred due to illness or disability for:

medical and surgical help, with the exception of laser eye treatments to replace glasses or contact lenses;

transport;

pharmaceutical devices provided on a doctor's prescription;

other devices, insofar as these devices are of such a nature that they are mainly used by sick or disabled persons;

(…)

(…)

(…)

travel in connection with regular visits to persons nursed for more than a month due to illness or disability, with whom the visitor ran a joint household at the start of the illness or disability, if the distance between the visitor's home or residence and the place where the nursing takes place, measured along the most usual road more than 10 kilometers.

4.9.
In paragraph 2 of Article 6.17 of the IB 2001 Act it is - insofar as relevant - stipulated that glasses are in any case not regarded as other aids.

4.10.
Article 6.17 (9) of the Wet IB 2001 stipulates that for the purposes of paragraph 1 (a), medical and surgical assistance means:

a treatment by a doctor;

a treatment by prescription and under the supervision of a doctor by a paramedic;

treatment by a paramedic to be designated by ministerial regulation, provided that a statement has been issued by the paramedic for the treatment that meets the conditions to be laid down by ministerial regulation.

4.11.
Article 6.18 of the IB 2001 Act includes a number of items that do not qualify as expenditure as referred to in Article 6.17 (1) of the IB 2001 Act, such as premiums and deductible for health insurance and personal contributions that are due .

4.12.
The Court will assess whether the expenditure for the specific healthcare costs has been pressed by the interested party within the meaning of Article 6.1 (1) (a) of the IB Act 2001. Costs that can be imposed on a taxable person can only be considered if the taxable person is compelled to pay these costs. from your own resources. Non-taxable expenditure is expenditure that is reimbursed or eligible for reimbursement. If there are pressing costs, it must then be assessed whether and to what amount the costs can be taken into account on the basis of Article 6.17 of the Wet IB 2001. The interested party rests with proof that he has incurred the deductible expenses for specific healthcare costs and that they have been imprinted on him.

2015

Pharmaceutical aids

4.13.
The interested party has deducted an amount of € 397 in costs for medicines. The Inspector has allowed a deduction of € 79 from this. The Court has not found any notes or other information in the court documents that shows that the interested party incurred more costs for medicines than € 79 printed on him.

Other tools

4.14.
The Inspector has rightly not allowed to deduct the costs for glasses because they are not regarded as other medical aids under Article 6.17 (2) of the Wet IB 2001. Furthermore, the Court did not find any notes or other information in the case documents that substantiate the costs claimed by it for Medipoint. This means that the interested party has failed to demonstrate that he has incurred expenditure on other resources. The Inspector rightly corrected this deduction.

Medicines and surgical assistance

4.15.
On the basis of the dispute documents, it has become plausible that the Inspector rightly did not allow deductible expenses because they could not be classified as medical or surgical aid or because they were explicitly excluded as expenses for specific healthcare costs in Article 6.18 of the IB Act 2001. . The interested party has not demonstrated with the documents submitted by him that a higher amount than the expenditure of € 88 accepted by the Inspector must be taken into account.

Travel costs for a sick visit

4.16.
It is not in dispute that the ex-partner of the interested party has not been hospitalized for longer than a month, so that the conditions of Article 6.17 (1), opening words and under h, of the Wet IB 2001 are not met. The Inspector has therefore rightly not allowed to deduct these costs.

Transportation costs

4.17.
There is no dispute between the parties that the interested party incurred transport costs for visiting medical care providers and undergoing medical treatments and that the interested party drove 1,811 km for this. In his letter of 9 June 2017, the interested party identified all costs for the costs per kilometer that were attributable to this, being € 4,503 for 2015 and € 4,388 for 2016. The interested party has a Daihatsu Charade, built in 2011 with a new value of € 14,978 . The interested party ultimately arrives at € 0.43 per km, based on the total number of km driven for 2015 and 2016 combined (20,500 km), while the Inspector assumes an amount of € 0.33 per km, based on the number of km for 2015 (12,019) separately. The Court held that in 2015 the Inspector was right to use the total number of km driven in that year to calculate the actual costs per km. The Inspector has calculated the number of km for the year 2015 on the basis of known mileages and petrol costs at 12,019. The interested party has failed to demonstrate that the number of kilometers driven was less in 2015. This means that the actual km costs as stated by the interested party must be recalculated to € 0.37 per km (€ 4,503: 12,019 km).

4.18.
Furthermore, the parties only disagree on the annual depreciation charges to be taken into account in this calculation. The interested party has submitted an offer by email from United Consumers, sent by email, to substantiate the depreciation of € 2,000 per year that it has taken into account, from which a daily value of the car of € 5,020 will follow on 10 March 2017. When the assessment was imposed, the Inspector lowered the depreciation to € 1,500, because a depreciation in seven years to € 978 does not seem realistic to him. The Court finds that the exact amount of the depreciation charges to be taken into account can remain in the middle because the Inspector at the appeal hearing stated that he wants to compensate the interested party by assuming € 0.40 per km. This km price is higher than the adjusted km price for 2015 of € 0.37 per km (see recital 4.17), based on the depreciation advocated by the interested party of € 2,000 per year. The interested party has failed to demonstrate that the parking costs exceed the € 63 that the Inspector has taken into account. The expenses for transport costs for 2015 can therefore be calculated at (1,811 km x € 0.40 =) € 724.40 + € 63 parking fee = € 788. As a result, the specific care costs for the year 2015 (after deduction of the threshold of € 768) to be calculated at € 1,507.

2016

Pharmaceutical aids

4.19.
The interested party has deducted an amount of € 124 in costs for medicines. The Inspector has allowed a deduction of € 14 from this. The Court has not found any notes or other information in the court documents that shows that the interested party incurred more costs for medicines than € 14 printed on him.

Medicines and surgical assistance

4.20.
The interested party has not made it plausible with the documents submitted by him, including the overviews of the health insurer, that the costs of medical and surgical assistance have weighed on him.

Travel costs for a sick visit

4.21.
The interested party has deducted travel expenses in connection with his parents' informal care and in connection with transport to the hospital. It has not been shown that the interested party ran a joint household with his parents at the start of the illness or disability, so that the conditions of Article 6.17, first paragraph, preamble and under h, of the Wet IB are not met. The Inspector has therefore rightly not allowed to deduct these costs.

Gifts 2015 and 2016

4.22.
Article 6.36 of the Wet IB 2001 provides, inter alia:

1. Gifts consisting of the waiver by a volunteer (…) of a consideration shall be considered if:

a. the institution has issued a statement that the taxpayer has volunteered (…);

b. the taxpayer can claim the compensation referred to in the statement;

c. the institution is willing and able to pay that fee, and

d. the taxpayer has the freedom to dispose of the compensation.

2. Gifts consisting of the waiver by the volunteer of allowances for actual costs incurred will be taken into consideration insofar as there are costs that should be reimbursed according to generally accepted social views, it being understood that costs for transport by car (…) are taken into account for € 0.19 per kilometer. The first sentence also applies in the situation in which the institution has not made a compensation arrangement for these costs.

4.23.
The interested party worked as a volunteer for many years at Stichting [B], Stichting [C], [D] and Zorgbelang [E] during the past years. He has submitted some volunteer agreements. The interested party has stated that he has waived compensation for his voluntary work at all four ANBI institutions, so that he can take this into account as a deduction for gifts. He did receive compensation for the actual transport costs incurred.

4.24.
It is established that the aforementioned institutions have not issued a statement as referred to in Article 6.36 of the IB 2001 Act. It is also not disputed that the other conditions included in Article 6.36 of the IB are not met. This means that the Inspector has rightly not allowed deduction of gifts in the form of waiving fees.

4.25.
The Inspector has rightly not allowed to deduct the other expenses deducted by the interested party. There is no generosity in membership payments to the union, so there is no question of a gift. Furthermore, the interested party has not demonstrated with verifiable data that he has made payments to Natuurmonumenten and Greenpeace, so that these amounts cannot be deducted as gifts either.

4.26.
The interested party also points out that in the years 2012, 2013 and 2014 the Inspector did allow deductible voluntary allowances, which he waived. Insofar as the interested party invokes the principle of confidentiality with this statement, this will fail. The Court held that trust to be protected in law requires more than the mere fact that the Inspector followed the declaration for a number of years when determining the assessment at a certain point. The legitimacy of the trust depends on the valuation of - to the extent necessary interrelated - circumstances that may have given the taxpayer the impression that a course of action followed by the inspector over a number of years is based on a well-considered position (Supreme Court) December 13, 1989, ECLI: NL: HR: ZC4179). The Court is of the opinion that the interested party has failed to demonstrate that circumstances have arisen that could give the impression that the Inspector deducting the deductions for donations claimed for the years 2012, 2013 and 2014 took the conscious position that the requested deduction would also be honored in 2015 and in 2016. It has also not been shown that the Inspector has made commitments or otherwise legally protected in the past to instill confidence in the interested party under which the gift deduction should be allowed in 2015 or 2016.

4.27.
The interested party also takes the view that the Inspector acted in violation of the general principles of good administration and, in particular, the principle of due care when imposing the IB / PVV 2015 and 2016 assessments, because information was allegedly leaked to his ex-partner. The Inspector disputes this. The Court considers that it follows from the documents in the case that the Inspector had intensive contact with the interested party both prior to the imposition of the assessments and during the objection phase. It has not become plausible that the principle of due care has been violated by providing confidential information of the interested party to third parties (the ex-partner).

4.28.
In any other way, the interested party has not made plausible a violation of any general principle of good administration with all that he has submitted.

Tax interest

4.29.
The interested party further states that unnecessary tax interest has been calculated by the inadequate decision-making process. The Court understands the interested party's point of view that the Inspector took unnecessarily long time to process his declaration and that he therefore has to pay unnecessary tax interest. The Court is of the opinion that the Inspector has not acted negligently by charging tax interest in accordance with the statutory provisions in the event of a correction of the declaration when imposing the final assessment. For the imposition of a final assessment, the inspector must take careful note of the contents of the declaration and, if he has doubts about the correctness of any information contained therein, must conduct a further investigation. This carefulness also means that in the performance of his task he has a certain freedom in the organization of his activities, compare Supreme Court 25 February 2011, ECLI: NL: HR: 2011: BP5536. The tax interest charged is the result of the corrections made by the Inspector. It has not been stated or it has become apparent that the tax interest has not been calculated in accordance with the applicable statutory regulations (Article 30fc, second paragraph, of the General State Taxes Act). In what the interested party has submitted, the Court sees no reason to reduce the tax interest charged further than correspondingly the reduction of the tax assessment IB / PVV 2015.

Damages

4.30.
The interested party has requested compensation for material and non-material damage suffered by him. The Court sees no reason for compensation for material or non-material damage. For an application for compensation for non-material damage due to the long duration of the proceedings, the Court concurs with the principles stated by the Supreme Court in the judgment of 19 February 2016, ECLI: NL: HR: 2016: 252. There is no question of exceeding deadlines due to the length of the procedure in the present cases.

5 Decision
Conclusion On the basis of the above, the appeal is well-founded.

Court fees and legal costs
Now that the Court has declared the appeal well-founded, the Inspector must reimburse the interested court fee paid to the interested party.

The Court sees reason to order the Inspector to pay the costs incurred by the interested party in handling the appeal and the appeal. The interested party's legal costs are in accordance with the Administrative Law (Administrative Costs) Decree for his travel and accommodation costs, estimated at € 40.


The Council:

- set aside the judgment of the Court,

- dismisses the action against the periodic penalty payment as unfounded,

- set aside the decision on objections for 2015,
