The woman appealed against the order of 17 April 2019 on 15 July 2019, as restored by order of 26 June 2019.

2.2
The man filed a statement of defense on 26 August 2019.

2.3
A piece from the side of the man, received on September 23, 2019, has also been received by the court.

2.4
The oral hearing took place on February 14, 2020. Published are:

- the woman, assisted by her lawyer;

- the man, assisted by his lawyer;

- the council, represented by Mr. W.R. Daalderop.

2.5
After the hearing, a fax letter from the Council of 14 February 2020 with enclosures was received, in which the Council representative corrected his advice given at the hearing. Parties have been given the opportunity to respond to the letter from the council.

2 Facts
3.1
From the marriage of the woman and the man (dissolved on 10 October 2018 by divorce), [the minor] was born on [date] 2016.

The woman and the man jointly exercise authority over [the minor]. [the minor] lives with the woman.

3.2
By order of the court of Noord-Holland (location Haarlem) of November 3, 2017, a care scheme has been determined by way of provisional provisions in the divorce proceedings, whereby [the minor] stays with the man on Friday from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Sundays from noon to 6 p.m.

3.3
By order of September 12, 2018, the court of Noord-Holland (location Haarlem), insofar as it is currently relevant, requested the council to conduct an investigation with regard to the care scheme. A temporary care arrangement has been established between the man and [the minor], whereby [the minor] is with the man on Friday from 2 pm to 6 pm and on Sunday from 10 am to 6 pm.

3.4
The documents are accompanied by a report from the Board of 7 February 2019. The Board considers it in [the minor's] interest to gradually grow towards biweekly contact weekends, including overnight stays with the man. The council took the young age of [the minor] into account when building up the care scheme. Until [the minor] is four years old (in [month] 2020), the Council advises him to stay with the man from Saturday 10:00 am to Sunday 6:00 pm. From the time that [the minor] is four years old, the council recommends that [the minor] stay with the man from Friday 2 p.m. to Sunday 6 p.m. With regard to the holidays, the advice is that [the minor] will spend two consecutive weeks in the summer in the summer in 2020 and twice a week during the summer. The holidays should be divided in half by the parents by mutual agreement.

3 Scope of Dispute
4.1
The contested decision, as restored by decision of 26 June 2019, stipulates that the definitive care arrangement will be as follows. [the minor] stays with the man:

until [the minor] is four years old ([date] 2020): from Saturday 10 am to Sunday 6 pm and from [date] 2020 every two weeks from Friday 2 pm to Sunday 6 pm;

from 1 January 2020 during half of the holidays, to be determined by mutual agreement between the parents;

for one week continuously in the Christmas holidays of 2020;

for one week continuously in the May holiday of 2021;

with effect from the summer holidays of 2021, each summer holiday for two consecutive weeks and twice a week every year during the school holidays divided by the year, to be determined in mutual consultation.

The man had requested to establish a care scheme whereby [the minor] will be with him once every fortnight from Friday 5:00 pm to Sunday 5:00 pm and during half of the holidays and public holidays.

The woman had requested to provide a care scheme in which [the minor] is with the man once a week on Sunday from noon to 4 p.m., or on Friday from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. and on Sunday from noon to 4 p.m.

4.2
With the annulment of the contested decision, the woman requests that a care arrangement between [the minor] and the husband be determined whereby [the minor] is with the husband:

- once every fortnight from Saturday 12 noon to Sunday 6 pm;

- from 1 January 2020 during half of the Islamic holidays, to be determined by mutual agreement between the parents;

- as from the Christmas holidays of 2020 during the May and Christmas holidays for three consecutive days, to be determined by mutual agreement between the parents, whereby the biweekly weekend arrangement will also continue;

- with effect from the summer holidays of 2021 during the summer holidays, twice during five consecutive days, to be determined in mutual consultation between the parents, whereby the biweekly weekend arrangement will also continue.

4.3
The man requests that the contested decision be ratified.

4 Reasons of the Decision
5.1
The woman argues that in determining the regular care scheme between [the minor] and the man, the court wanted to follow the care scheme recommended by the council in its report of 7 February 2019, but that the court was incorrectly reading that advice as far as the period up to [month] 2020 is concerned. The wording by the council is not entirely clear, but the woman assumes that the recommended schedule is intended as a biweekly (and not weekly) schedule. This is obvious now that the council speaks of a constructive arrangement, while the schedule determined by the court refers to a decreasing arrangement; until the age of four [the minor] sees the man more often than from his fourth birthday. The woman further points out that the husband has not requested a weekly arrangement.

In addition, the woman states that a weekly arrangement is not in the interest of [the minor], because such an arrangement means that he does not spend any weekend with the woman. This also dilutes [the minor] bond with the woman's family.

5.2
The man states that the court has correctly followed the advice of the council. Since the order of November 3, 2017, the man [the minor] has been with him every weekend on Friday and Sunday. It is not logical that the council would have meant that this scheme should be reduced to a weekend every two weeks. [the minor] is not yet in school and the woman is not working, so that the woman can already spend enough time with [the minor] outside the weekends. It is only when [the minor] goes to school in [month] 2020 that the woman has an interest that [the minor] also spends weekends with her, which is why the care scheme has been determined every two weeks from that moment.

5.3
The report of the Board of 7 February 2019 shows the following, among other things.

[the minor] is developing well, he experiences both his parents as very positive and he has enough strength to have contact with the man. Both parents offer a good parenting environment and they appreciate the relationship [the minor] has with the other parent. The council does see a risk of loyalty problems if the conflict between the parents about the care arrangement continues. It is necessary for [the minor] that a clear, adequate care scheme is determined and that it is observed.

At the appeal hearing, the council recommended that the contested decision be ratified. [the minor] has a great interest in good, regular contact with the man. In view of the age of [the minor] and in view of the growth of trust between the parties, the regular care arrangement determined by the court is in the interest of [the minor].

After the hearing, the Board corrected the aforementioned advice and stated that the Board intended in its report of 7 February 2019 to advise that [the minor] stays with the man every two weeks, whereby [the minor] also spends the night with the man.

5.4
The court finds that both the woman and the man on appeal stated that the regular care scheme is implemented in accordance with the contested decision, so that [the minor] stays with the man every weekend during the weekend, and that the scheme runs smoothly. . Previously, [the minor] also stayed with the man every week, on the understanding that he did not spend the night with him, but spent twice a day with the man.

The council report also shows that [the minor] develops positively and that he has a strong bond with both parents. Both the woman and the man offer [the minor] a good parenting environment. In view of the above and taking into account the young age of [the minor], the court considers regular contact of [the minor] with the man in [the minor] 's interest. As long as he is not yet attending school, in the opinion of the court he should therefore continue to visit the man every week, from Saturday 10 am to Sunday 6 pm. The wish of the woman to also be able to spend a weekend with [the minor] is palpable, but now that she is currently not (yet) working and that she therefore already has [the minor] with her five days a week, the court sees insufficient reason to meet that wish of the woman. The woman has further argued that she is dependent on the weekends for visiting her family. The court agrees with the woman that [the minor] has an interest in maintaining ties with his maternal family, but in the opinion of the court this interest weighs less than the interest of [the minor] in regular contact with his father, all the more so because [the minor] will go to school in [month] 2020 and will then change the care arrangement with the man into a bi-weekly arrangement. There is no dispute about that arrangement. Within the foreseeable future, the woman can therefore spend a weekend with [the minor] twice a month and visit her family.

According to the contested decision, the weekend arrangement starts at 10:00 on Saturdays. On appeal, the woman requested to determine the care scheme from Saturday at noon. Now that it has not explained this request to change the time, and the Court of Appeal has not, moreover, shown that a change in the start time is necessary, the Court will ratify the contested decision with regard to the regular care regulations stipulated therein.

5.5
The woman also brought up the holiday scheme; she thinks it is too intensive for [the minor]. Since birth, he has never been separated from her for more than two weeks. She also wonders whether the man can bear this responsibility.

5.6
The man argues that what the woman has put forward as objections to the holiday scheme is not sufficiently important. Nowhere does it appear that the man could not take care of [the minor] for two consecutive weeks. The fact that this has not happened before does not mean that it is not possible.

5.7
At the hearing, the council stated on appeal that [the minor] can be with the man for two weeks in a row, given his age and development. It is important that the parties do not fight over the holidays.

5.8
The court is in line with this advice from the council and will also ratify the contested decision with regard to the holiday arrangement. It has not been shown that a two-week stay with the man is in conflict with the interest of [the minor], regardless of whether the man stays with his parents with [the minor] or not.

5.9
Finally, the woman has objected to the arrangement during the holidays, where the court seems to mean the Christian holidays. The woman and [the minor] are Islamic and the woman does not want to inform [the minor] that the Christian holidays are special days; on those days she therefore wants to maintain the regular care scheme. She agrees that [the minor] stays with men for half of the Islamic holidays.

5.10
At the hearing, the man stated on appeal that he too is Islamic, but that he must work on the Islamic holidays. If [the minor] goes to school, he will also not be free on the Islamic holidays. Since the man is free on Christian holidays, he would like to spend part of it with [the minor]. He also asked to specify how the public holidays should be distributed; according to the man, a public holiday is a day including overnight stay, but the woman wishes [the minor] to stay with the man for only half a day.

5.11
The court finds that both parties are Islamic and that they do not celebrate Christian holidays. This does not alter the fact that [the minor] will go to school by [month] 2020 and that he will be free on official holidays such as King's Day, but also on Christian holidays such as Easter and Pentecost. It is in [the minor's] interest that he can also spend part of those days off with the man. The fact that the woman [the minor] does not want to share with her religious beliefs that Christian holidays are special does not change the fact that they are days off and that an arrangement must be made for those days. The contested decision will therefore also be ratified on this point. In doing so, the Court of Appeal assumes that dividing the holidays by half means that [the minor] will be with the man half the day in the case of one public holiday (such as King's Day) and that in the case of two public holidays (such as Christmas and Easter) one day of that including overnight stay with the man. Parties are of course free to mutually agree on the stay of [the minor] with each of them during the Islamic holidays.

5.12
This leads to the next decision.
