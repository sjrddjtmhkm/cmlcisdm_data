2a. Admissibility of the Public Prosecutor's Office

Among the facts 1 and 3 is suspected abuse of his ex-partner in the period from September 5, 2006 to December 31, 2010 (fact 1) and children in the period from September 5, 2006 to April 13, 2017 (fact 3) charged. The maximum sentence for the mistreatment of a spouse and / or child is 4 years. At such a maximum penalty, the limitation period is 12 years. The subpoena was issued on March 2, 2020. This means that the acts committed before March 2, 2008 are time-barred and that the Public Prosecution Service will be declared inadmissible in respect of facts 1 and 3 for the period from September 5, 2006 to March 2, 2008.

2b. Evidence Considerations

Period to be assessed after March 2, 2008

At the hearing, the public prosecutor stated that she intended to charge only for the ill-treatment committed in the Netherlands. It follows from the file that the suspect and his family came to the Netherlands on September 28, 2010. The court will therefore shorten the period to be assessed. This means that the period to be assessed in respect of fact 1 is from September 28, 2010 until December 31, 2010 and in respect of fact 3, the period is from September 28, 2010 until April 13, 2017.

Considerations

2 Facts

On the basis of the evidence, the following, which is not further disputed, is determined.

The suspect was married to [wife] from 1997 to August 2, 2017.

The suspect has four daughters together with [wife], namely:

- [child 1], born on [date of birth of child 1] in [place of birth of children];

- [child 2], born on [date of birth of child 2] in [place of birth of children];

- [child 3], born on [date of birth of child 3] in [place of birth of children];

- [child 4], born on [date of birth of child 4] in [place of birth of children].

On September 28, 2010 they arrived as a family in the Netherlands in the Asylum Seekers Center (AZC) in Amersfoort. In March 2011 they got a house in Wageningen. On April 13, 2017, the suspect left the house.

Scope of Dispute

With regard to fact 1: the abuse of [wife] in the period of

September 28, 2010 until December 31, 2010

The prosecutor's position

The public prosecutor has stated that, based on the report and the statements of the daughters, it can be legally and convincingly proven that the suspect was guilty of the abuse of [wife] by grabbing her by the throat and close it. and hit and push her several times. The public prosecutor considers the other acts of violence to be unlawful and convincing.

The position of the defense

The defense took the position that the suspect should be acquitted of the mistreatment of [wife], because there is insufficient legal and convincing evidence in the file.

Judgment by the court

As stated, [wife] and suspect stayed in the AZC in Amersfoort from September 28, 2010 to March 2011, at that time they were married.

[wife] has stated that the suspect became very aggressive towards her and the children during an argument at the AZC in Amersfoort. At one point, the suspect grabbed her by the throat and closed it. She was knocked unconscious and she fell to the ground.

[child 1] stated that about three months after arriving at the AZC she saw that her father grabbed her mother by the throat with his hands. She was shocked because her mother made no noise. At the time, she thought her mother was dead.

The defendant stated about this that he then grabbed [wife] by the throat and pushed it. The suspect has denied having closed her throat.

In view of the foregoing, the court considers that it has been legally and convincingly proven that the suspect [wife] has mistreated by grabbing her by the throat and pressing it shut. The statement by [child 1], that her mother was no longer making a sound and that she thought her mother was dead, fits the statement by [wife] that she was unconscious by squeezing her throat. Pinching the throat is also related to grabbing the throat, which the suspect does not deny.

With regard to the other accused acts of violence, the court considers as follows. In her declaration regarding the accused period, [wife] only stated about the incident in the AZC in Amersfoort in which she was grabbed by the throat. She also stated that the suspect had no longer abused her after this incident until 2017; she cannot remember this. Therefore, the court does not consider the other accused acts of violence to be lawful and convincing, since it cannot establish that they also took place during the period under assessment. The court will acquit the suspect of those acts of violence.

With regard to fact 2: the abuse of [wife] in the period of

January 1, 2017 until April 27, 2017

The prosecutor's position

The public prosecutor has stated that, based on the report, the statements of the daughters and the self-declaration of the suspect, it can be proved legally and convincingly that the suspect was guilty of the mistreatment of [wife], by her grab her throat and squeeze it, grab her arm and squeeze it and hit her. The public prosecutor considers the other acts of violence to be unlawful and convincing.

The position of the defense

The defense took the position that it cannot be lawfully and convincingly proven that the suspect [wife] has abused by grabbing her by the throat and by grabbing her arm and squeezing it. It has been argued to this effect that [wife] stated that she had only been home when the suspect grabbed her by the throat. She has not stated anything about the coming home of their daughter [child 2]. Nevertheless, [child 2] declares to have seen the incident. This statement is therefore implausible, so that insufficient legal and convincing evidence remains. With regard to squeezing the arm, the defense states that the suspect did not have the intention to hurt [wife] with this. He just wanted to talk to her.


As established, [wife] and suspect received a house in Wageningen in March 2011, where they also stayed together in mid-April 2017. They were married in the alleged period.

Grasp by the throat, close the throat and push against the body

[wife] has stated that she came to her home in Wageningen on April 13, 2017. She heard and saw that the suspect was angry and started yelling at her. He became aggressive and then [wife] saw and felt that the suspect was pushing her towards the bedroom. She saw and felt that the suspect grabbed her throat with his right hand. She felt him close her throat.

[Child 2] stated that she came home on April 12, 2017 and heard screams from her parents. She went to their room and saw that her father was strangling her mother, he pushed her against the wall and took her by the throat with both hands. [child 2] yelled at her father after that and he withdrew his hands.

The suspect has stated that he sometimes grabbed [wife] by the throat during arguments in 2017. He also stated to have pushed her. He has denied having closed the throat of [wife].

On the basis of the foregoing, the court considers that it has been legally and convincingly proven that the suspect [wife] has repeatedly grabbed her throat and pushed it against her body during the alleged period. The court does not consider it proven that he also closed the throat of [wife]. The events of April 13, 2017 follow only from the declaration of [wife] and are not supported by other evidence. The statement of [child 2] is the day before, namely on April 12, 2017. In addition, [child 2] uses the word strangling, which she then describes as the act, in which the suspect is holding her wife with his two hands. takes. However, it does not follow from this description that the defendant also closed the throat of [wife]. The court will therefore acquit the suspect of this part of the indictment.

Pinch the arm

[wife] further stated that on April 27, 2017 she met a suspect in the center of Wageningen. He walked over to her and took her right arm with his right hand. [wife] felt the suspect squeeze hard and push her in one direction. By squeezing [wife] had a sore arm. [child 1] stated that she saw her father taking her mother by the hand and pulling her along.

The suspect has stated that it is true that he [wife] pinched her arm hard.

On the basis of the above, the court considers that it has been legally and convincingly proven that the suspect [wife] has squeezed hard. By doing so, the suspect has knowingly accepted the significant chance that he would inflict [wife] pain.

In conclusion

In view of the above, the court considers that the suspect has been legally and convincingly proven

[wife] in the accused period assaulted by gripping her by the throat several times and pushing it against the body and by squeezing her arm hard once. The court does not consider the other acts of violence charged against him to be legally and convincingly proven. [spouse] did not report other violent incidents in the alleged period. The court will therefore acquit the suspect of the other acts of violence brought against him.

Regarding fact 3: the mistreatment of the defendant's daughters during the period

from September 28, 2010 until April 13, 2017

The prosecutor's position

The public prosecutor has stated that, based on the reports of the children and the self-statements of the suspect, it can be legally and convincingly proven that the suspect is guilty of the abuse of [child 3], [child 2], [ child 1] and [child 4], as charged.

The position of the defense

With regard to fact 3, the defense refers to the opinion of the court.

Judgment by the court

As stated, the daughters and their parents arrived on September 28, 2010 at the AZC in Amersfoort. In March 2011 they received a house in Wageningen where they stayed together at the time of the accused period.

The suspect has stated that he sometimes hit his children with a kind of ruler on their arm or feet, to wake them up or because they had to do homework. He also stated that he tapped his children. The suspect hit his children hard on the shoulder. He also sometimes tapped his children, pushed them, and pinched them. When his children had a fight, the suspect sometimes pushed his children under the tap. He washed their face with cold water. He has done this once or twice. The suspect has denied that [child 2] collided with the head against the washbasin.

[child 2] has stated that in March 2010 (the court understands March 2011), she dropped a cup on the floor at the AZC in Amersfoort. Her father then slapped her on the shoulder, which hurt her greatly. He also hit her head twice with force. On June 20, 2013, her father repeatedly hit her on the head while doing her homework. He grabbed her left arm hard and pushed her into the bathroom. He grabbed her neck and pushed her head to the tap. She felt cold water on her hair and face. Her father then kicked her in the left leg. [child 2] has stated when pushing under the tap that the suspect had bumped her head against the sink. On November 13, 2013, her father slapped her right hand on the head.

[child 3] has stated that on June 15, 2015, her father used a kind of rolling pin with which he regularly hit her on the legs and arms to wake her up. She also saw that he did this to her sisters. When her father cried, her father took her to the bathroom and hit her on the legs with a stick. Her legs became red and thick at the time. On April 9, 2017, she saw that her father beat [child 4]. On April 10 or 11, 2017, her father [child 3] hit her head with great force. Then her father kicked her with great force against her thigh.

[child 1] stated that in March 2011 her father punched her in the face with his right hand and with great force. In April 2011, her father hit her right shoulder with her right hand and squeezed her right arm with force. She has suffered a bruise. About a month later, her father squeezed her hand very hard and she felt pain in her hand.

[child 4] has stated that her father mistreated her for the first time in 2010. She was beaten with a cane almost every day. He then hit her legs, back and shoulders. When she was 6 years old (the court understands in 2012) her father slapped her on the shoulders.

In view of the foregoing, viewed in conjunction, the court finds that it has been legally and convincingly proven that the defendant has abused [child 3], [child 2], [child 1] and [child 4] in the period from September 28, 2010 until and including April 13, 2017. He did this by hitting them against the head and against the body, by the bare hand or with an object, by the arm and then squeezing the arm, gripping the neck and then keep your head under cold water, by pushing them against your body and by kicking them against your legs. The court also considers it proven that [child 2] bumped her head into the sink. Although the defendant has denied that this has happened, the court sees no reason to doubt the statement of [child 2] on this point. It is a specific event, related to keeping the head underwater, which the suspect does not deny.

The court does not consider it proven that the suspect [child 1] punched in the face now that there is no supporting evidence for this.

3 Appeal

In the opinion of the court, it has been legally and convincingly proven that the suspect committed the charges under facts 1 to 3, namely that:

1.

he once or several times in or around the period from September 28, 2010 to

Insofar as there are obvious language and / or writing errors in the indictment, these errors have been corrected. As a result, the suspect has not been harmed in his defense.

What has been charged more or differently than has been proven previously has not been proven.

The suspect must be acquitted of this.

4 Reasons of the Decision
The proven statement provides:

Regarding facts 1 and 2:

Abuse committed against his wife, committed several times

Regarding fact 3:

Committed assault to his children, committed several times

5 The criminality of the facts
The offenses are punishable.

6 The suspect's criminality
The suspect is punishable, now that no circumstance has been demonstrated or made plausible that excludes the suspect's criminality.

7 Considerations with regard to punishment and / or measure
The prosecutor's position

The public prosecutor has demanded that, in view of the fact that there is domestic violence, the type of violence that has been committed and the time lapse, the accused will be sentenced to 180 hours of community service and a suspended sentence. imprisonment for 8 weeks with a probation period of 2 years.

The position of the defense

The defense took the position that the required community service should be moderate. To this end it has been argued that the suspect has no contact with two of his children and that he has already been punished enough. With regard to the required conditional part, the defense states that there is no reason to assume that the suspect would do anything to his children again.

Judgment by the court

In determining the sentence to be imposed, the court has, given the nature and seriousness of what has been proven, the circumstances under which this was committed, also in view of the person and circumstances of the suspect, such as the investigation during the hearing has emerged, in particular with regard to:

- the excerpt from judicial documentation, dated February 19, 2020;

- an information report from the Probation Service of the Netherlands, dated March 5, 2020.

The suspect has been guilty of the assault of his ex-wife for a total of approximately 1 year and the assault of his children for approximately 6.5 years. The assaults often took place at home. This is pre-eminently the place where you should feel safe. By acting in this way, the suspect has completely removed these feelings of security. Both his ex-wife and his children were constantly afraid of being abused by him again. The court strongly blames this suspect.

In favor of the suspect, the court accepts that he has no criminal record. Moreover, the latest facts date from almost three years ago and have not proved to be a good reason for the considerable lapse of time since the declarations in March / April 2018. It follows from the probation advice of 5 March 2020 that no signals of any form of threat / transgressive behavior towards his ex-wife or daughters have been observed by Veilig Thuis, the local police officer and an employee of the social district team in the past eighteen months. It also follows from the advice that the probation service spoke to two of his daughters and that there has been no threat, fear or transgressive behavior towards them in the past year and a half. According to the advice, they have no fear of their father. The suspect seems to have accepted the divorce and is shaping his own life. He has work, a home and is now completely debt-free. The Probation Service recommends that a sentence be imposed without imposing special conditions.

Now that the latest facts have been committed in 2017 and there has been no question of any transgressive behavior of the suspect towards his ex-wife and children for a long time, there is no reason to impose a suspended sentence.

Because the court comes to a less far-reaching statement of evidence than the public prosecutor, and because (more than the public prosecutor may have done) it takes into account the considerable time lapse, it will moderate the required community service. In view of all the above, the court considers a community service sentence of 100 hours to be appropriate and appropriate.

7a. The assessment of civil claims, as well as the advanced imposition of the compensation measure

The following injured parties have joined criminal proceedings to obtain damages:

[spouse] (facts 1 and 2) claims an amount of € 3,500 (only intangible damage);

[child 1] (fact 3) claims an amount of € 2,600 (only intangible damage);

[child 2] (fact 3) claims an amount of € 2,600 (only intangible damage);

[child 3] (represented by Ms [wife]) (fact 3) claims an amount of € 2,600 (only intangible damage);

[child 4] (represented by Ms [wife]) (fact 3) claims an amount of € 2,600 (only intangible damage).

In addition, it was requested to increase the damage to be compensated by statutory interest and to impose the compensation measure.

The prosecutor's position

The public prosecutor has taken the position that the claims of the injured parties are sufficiently substantiated and can be fully allocated, with an increase in the statutory interest and the imposition of the compensation measure.

The position of the defense

The defense took the position that the claims should be dismissed or that the injured parties should be declared inadmissible in their claims. To this end, it has been argued that the claims are insufficiently substantiated.

Judgment by the court

The claims of the injured parties are based on the long-term harm in their person, taking the injured parties made a distinction between the physical injury suffered and the psychological injury suffered.

Regarding the claim of injured party [spouse]

The court is of the opinion that, given the nature of the acts of violence proven under facts 1 and 2, it is sufficiently plausible that the injured party has caused non-material damage. Under Article 6: 106 paragraph 1 of the Dutch Civil Code, the injured party is entitled to compensation for the non-material damage to be determined in an equitable manner, since an infringement of her physical integrity has been committed and, moreover, it is plausible that she is the result of the acts of violence have had pain and have been injured, consisting of bruises and a sore throat. Based on the circumstances set by the injured party and taking into account the compensation awarded in similar cases, the court estimates the intangible damages in an equitable and fair way at € 350.

The court will award the injured party's claim up to this amount, plus statutory interest from the date of filing of the claim, which is May 8, 2019.

Although the court can imagine that the facts have left their mark on the injured party, it is of the opinion that it has insufficiently substantiated with concrete evidence that actual psychological damage has occurred. Further investigation into whether this damage occurred, and its level, would place a disproportionate burden on the criminal proceedings.

The injured party will be declared inadmissible for the more claimed intangible damages in the claim. It can bring the remaining part of the claim to a civil court.

Regarding the claims of the injured parties [child 1], [child 2], [child 3] and [child 4]

The court is of the opinion that, given the nature of the acts of violence declared under fact 3, it is sufficiently plausible that the injured parties have suffered non-material damage. Pursuant to Article 6: 106 paragraph 1 of the Civil Code, the injured parties are entitled to fair compensation for the non-material damage, since an infringement of her physical integrity has been committed and, moreover, it is plausible that she is the result of the acts of violence have been painful and injured, including bruising and bruising. Based on the circumstances set by the injured parties and taking into account the compensation awarded in similar cases, the court estimates the intangible damages in an equitable and fair manner per injured party on

€ 500.

The court will award the injured parties' claims up to this amount, plus statutory interest from the date of filing of the claim, which is May 8, 2019.

Although the court can imagine that the facts have left their mark on the injured parties, it is of the opinion that they have insufficiently substantiated with substantiated evidence that actual psychological damage has occurred. Further investigation into whether this damage occurred, and its level, would place a disproportionate burden on the criminal proceedings.

The injured parties will be declared inadmissible for the more advanced intangible damages in the claims. They can bring the remainder of the claim to a civil court.

Compensation for damages

In view of the above, the court sees reason to impose on the suspect an obligation to pay to the State the amount to be allocated for the aforementioned injured parties on the basis of the provisions of Article 36f of the Criminal Code.
