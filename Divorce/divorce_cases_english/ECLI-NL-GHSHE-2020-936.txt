2 Facts
3.1.
From the now broken relationship of [the mother 2] and [the mother 1] (then still the father) - insofar as relevant here - were born:

- [the minor 1] (hereinafter referred to as: [the minor 1]), on [date of birth] 2010, in [place of birth]

- [the minor 2] (hereinafter referred to as: [the minor 2]), on [date of birth] 2012, in [place of birth];

hereafter also together: the children.

[the mother 1] has a new partner. In the relationship between [the mother 1] and her new partner, [the minor 3] was born on [date of birth] 2019. [the minor 3] has been placed under surveillance.

3.2.
[the mother 1] has recognized the children.

[the mother 1] and [the mother 2] were married on October 1, 2013. By order of the court of Zeeland-West Brabant of 13 May 2015, the parties divorced, which was registered on 1 June 2015 in the registers of civil status.

[Mother 2] and [Mother 1] exercised joint parental authority over the children until the contested decision.

3.3.
In April 2014, the children went to live with their individual foster parents in a voluntary framework.

3.4.
By order of the juvenile court judge of the court of Zeeland-West Brabant of April 5, 2016, the children have been placed under the supervision of the GI with effect from April 5, 2016 and an authorization has been granted to place the children away from home in a facility for foster care as of April 5, 2016. The supervision and the authorization of out-of-home placement have subsequently been extended and will continue to apply until April 5, 2020.

3.5.
In the contested decision - declared enforceable - the court terminated the authority of [the mother 1] and [the mother 2] over the children and the GI was appointed guardian over the children.

3.6.
[the mother 1] cannot agree with this decision as far as the termination of her authority over [the minor 1] and [the minor 2] is concerned and she has appealed against this.

During the oral hearing of the court, she withdrew her request insofar as the appeal was directed against the termination of her authority over [the minor 2]. The court understands that [the mother 1] does not maintain her grievances as far as [the minor 2] is concerned. This leads to the court declaring [the mother 1] inadmissible to that extent.

The following therefore only relates to [the minor 1].

3 Appeal
3.7.
In summary, as supplemented during the oral hearing, [the mother 1] argues the following.

[Mother 1] disagreed with the board's research design. She did not agree that the school and the game therapist of [the minor 1] should not be involved as informants. They could have provided objective and current information. [the minor 1] himself should also have been heard. [the minor 1] knows about the procedure and she has the right to be heard, despite her young age (Article 12 CRC).

[the mother 1] is capable of carrying the care and upbringing for [the minor 1], at least she will be able to do so within an acceptable period. She wants to work on the relationship with [the mother 2] and the foster parents of [the minor 1]. [the mother 1] will continue to promote contact between [the minor 1] and the foster parents. She will also ensure that [the minor 1] can continue to attend her current school.

There are no uncertainties and uncertainties about the parenting situation at [the mother 1]. The intended move to [place] may be postponed if this is deemed to be in the interest of [the minor 1]. The supervision of [the minor 3] is based on the (previous) supervision of [the minor 1] and [the minor 2] and the supervision of the children of her new partner.

The GI has never focused on home placement and has never investigated the teaching skills of [the mother 1], despite the fact that the out-of-home placement should be regarded as an ultimate remedy. Even before the supervision and custodial placement were pronounced, the GI had taken the position that the perspective of [the minor 1] was in the foster home.

[the minor 1] is not vulnerable. With [the mother 1] she is open and shows herself. She does not get that space in the foster family, [the mother 1] knows from her own experience, because the foster parents of [the minor 1] are her parents.

Authority has ended only because of the passage of time. [Minor 1] is still more securely attached to [the mother 1] than to the foster parents, so that a transfer does not have to be harmful. Growing up in a foster family also has negative consequences for the development of a child.

Although [the minor 1] was previously told that she will remain in the foster family, [the minor 1] also knew that [the mother 1] will take care of [the minor 1] herself in the future. An investigation under Article 810a of the Code of Civil Procedure (Rv) therefore does not have to harm [the minor 1]. An expert opinion offers [the mother 1] a fair position in this procedure, or a means to accept the foster family placement.

It must be concluded that the legal criteria of Article 1: 266 of the Dutch Civil Code (BW) are not met.

3.8.
In summary, the Council puts forward the following during the oral hearing.

The council's policy is that children are only heard from twelve years of age in a council investigation. [the minor 1] was nine years old at the time of the study and therefore too young. Her hearing would have been too burdensome, also given her vulnerability. The information from school and game therapy was included in the study via the GI. The game therapy also stopped in January 2019, so that that information was no longer current at the time of the council investigation.

There is still no clarity about whether [the mother 1] will move (in the long term) to [place]. [the minor 3] has been placed under surveillance and so [the minor 3] was threatened in his development when the supervision was pronounced. The situation at [the mother 1] is therefore unchanged. The council considers the statement of [the mother 1] that she will promote contacts between [the minor 1] and the foster family contrary to the extent to which she disqualifies the foster family. [the mother 1] is variable in her positions.

Home placement has not been used since 2015. All reports always state why it could no longer be discussed. [the mother 1] went along with that vision. She can come back to this, but it is difficult for [the minor 1] and the authorities involved to go along with this and to adjust the policy accordingly.

Not only because of the passage of time, authority has ended: the decision is also substantively substantiated. [the mother 1] has not initiated any research into her pedagogical skills and the possibilities of home placement. However, there are also practical reasons why a return to the home situation was not possible. That [the minor 1] is vulnerable, is already evident from the fact that she has followed play therapy. The claim of [the mother 1] that [the minor 1] is not vulnerable has not been substantiated and this is also at odds with the experiences of all other parties involved around [the minor 1]. [the mother 1] projects her own experiences in the foster family in the past onto [the minor 1].

An article 810a DCCP investigation would burden [the minor 1], while she should not be bothered by the disputes between [the mother 1] and the GI. When [the mother 1] says that an investigation could help her in the process of acceptance, [the minor 1] must be able to count on that acceptance.

The Council concludes that the contested decision should be ratified.

3.9.
[mother 2] briefly summarized the following during the oral hearing.

[the mother 2] understands and supports the decision of the council not to hear [the minor 1]. That would have overburdened [the minor 1]. The most important information from school and game therapy was included in the study. [The mother 1] first stated in the statement of defense at first instance that she did not agree with the research plan.

The children have been clearly told that they can grow up in the foster home, not that they will possibly return to one of the parents. At the time, the possibilities of home placement were sufficiently investigated. But even if that had not happened, it is not in the children's interest to investigate that now. They are attached to the foster home and used to the situation.

[the mother 1] gives insufficient openness. That she would no longer want to move to [place] is new for [the mother 2]. There is little insight into the situation in [the mother 1].

That [the minor 1] is vulnerable is seen by all involved. Everyone describes the behavior of [the minor 1] the same, except [the mother 1]. However, no one sees the behavior of [the minor 1] with Mrs. [the mother 1], because no one visits or is allowed to come over there because the relationships are not good.

Not only because of the passage of time, the authority has ended, but also because of the poor communication between [the mother 1] and all other important persons in the life of [the minor 1] and the structural uncertainties about the weekends in which [the minor 1] resides with [the mother 1].

[the mother 2] sees no added value in a further investigation. It is in the interest of the children that they can grow up stably and that the procedures stop.

The ultimate wish of [the mother 2] is that the custody of [the minor 1] (and [the minor 2]) is ultimately placed with the foster parents, so that they can make the important choices for the children.

3.10.
Briefly summarized, the foster parents of [the minor 1] made the following statements.

The foster parents regret that [the mother 1] talks about them so negatively. The situation of the foster parents has been stable for a long time. The foster parents are convinced that they can offer [the minor 1] what she needs.

[Minor 1] has already been told twice that she may grow up in the foster family. She has said that she is happy that she can continue to live in the foster home and continue to go to her own school, with her own friends. She feels at home with the foster parents and she trusts them.

[the minor 1] is experiencing cautious growth. She benefits from the therapy. Support is given at school in connection with her dyslexia.

The foster parents regret the bad relationship with [the mother 1]. In the past they have noticed that they are either doing very well or very badly; there was little in between. The foster parents like that superficial contact is now possible with the transfer of [the minor 1].

3.11.
The GI has submitted an email from the youth care worker to [the mother 1] of 19 December 2018 with the subject “arguments for growing up perspective [the minor 1]” explaining why the GI believes that [the minor 1] in a foster family should grow up, not with [the mother 1]. The GI has also submitted the family report / plan of approach in the context of the guardianship of 16 January 2020.

4 Reasons of the Decision
3.12.
The court considers the following.

3.12.1.
Pursuant to Article 1: 266 of the Civil Code (BW), the authority of a parent over one or more of his children can be ended if:

a minor grows up in such a way that he is seriously threatened in his development, and the parent is not able to bear the responsibility for the care and upbringing, referred to in Article 1: 247 paragraph 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, within one for the person and the development of the minor deemed acceptable term, or

the parent abuses authority.

3.12.2.
Just like the court and on the same grounds as the court, which the court takes over and makes it its own after appreciation and consideration, the court considers that [the minor 1] grows up in such a way that she is seriously threatened in her development, and [ the mother 1] is unable to bear the responsibility for the care and upbringing, referred to in Section 1: 247 paragraph 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, within a period that is acceptable to the person and the development of [the minor 1].

3.12.3.
The complaints of [the mother 1] are directed in particular against the considerations of the court in the contested decision regarding the council's method of investigation and the question whether [the mother 1] in the context of the supervision and placement of [the minor 1] sufficient opportunities are offered to take care of [the minor 1] again (and in that context: whether sufficient research has been done into her pedagogical qualities).

3.12.4.
The attitude of [the mother 1] about the foster family placement of [the minor 1] has been very variable before the supervision and custody placement in April 2014, but also afterwards. Finally, in 2016, both parents, in the presence of the GI and the foster parents, told [the minor 1] that she may continue to grow up in the foster family. This gave [the minor 1] a rest. At that time, [the mother 1] herself was of the opinion that she could not offer [the minor 1] a perspective, also because of practical and financial obstacles. In July 2017, [the mother 1] returned to this position. In the opinion of the court, the GI could not be expected to move along with [mother 1] without further ado, especially in view of the potentially confusing signal that this would send to [the minor 1].

3.12.5.
[The mother 1] believes that she should still be given an opportunity to work towards the home placement of [the minor 1], because she sees opportunities for this in herself and in [the minor 1].

However, [the mother 1] has failed to provide any at least sufficient insight into her current (living) situation. Much is unclear about this. It is also not clear how concrete the moving plans of [the mother 1] are. Nor has it been made clear in any way on the basis of which circumstances the supervision of [the minor 3] came about.

In addition, the "acceptable period" has already expired in the case of [the minor 1]. [the minor 1] is almost ten years old and she has lived in the foster home for almost six years, where she is developing well. In the foster home, in addition to a stable parenting environment and a responsible educational climate, she is offered the support and guidance she needs to develop optimally within her capabilities.

[the minor 1] desperately needs no change in this situation. She also needs to be able to tell her clearly and without reservation that she can stay in the foster family, especially now that - given the wish of [the mother 1] - she can no longer feel that she is being 'pulled' by her. .

3.12.6.
Insofar as [the mother 1] does not agree with the way in which information from school and game therapy has been processed in the council investigation or report, it is established that she has not made concrete in what way and to what extent the information that indirectly comes from these sources. would have been improperly incorporated into the board's report. The grievances therefore fail to that extent.

In addition, the complaints fail to the extent that they relate to the decision of the council not to hear [the minor 1]. In view of her young age (at the time of the Board investigation 9 years) and the fact that she is vulnerable, it was by no means careless not to include [the minor 1] in the investigation. [the minor 1] went through a lot, given the divorce of her parents, the placement in the foster home, the complicated family / family structure and the tensions between the important people in her life. [the minor 1] has crying spells and she finds it difficult to name and express her feelings. Play therapy is (has been) necessary to support her in this. In view of this, it is therefore sufficiently plausible that [the minor 1], contrary to what [the mother 1] argues, is a young vulnerable girl, which the Board rightly took into consideration when deciding not to hear her.

Expert investigation pursuant to Article 810 a Rv

3.12.7.
Article 810a paragraph 2 DCCP stipulates that in cases concerning the supervision of minors, the judge appoints an expert at the request of a parent and after consultation with that parent, provided that this can also lead to the decision of the case and the best interests of the child arise. do not oppose this. The aim of this provision is to promote that parents of minors can, if desired, refute a substantiated statement of the Council for Child Protection in a matter concerning a measure of youth protection, which has a material impact on privacy and on family and family life, even if is a GI position. Article 810a paragraph 2 DCCP applies not only in cases concerning the supervision of minors, but also in cases concerning the placement of minors away from home (see the decision of the Supreme Court of 12 April 2019, ECLI: NL: HR: 2019: 575, legal consideration 3.3.3).

3.11.8.
It follows from case law of the Supreme Court that a sufficiently concrete and relevant request for the application of Article 810a paragraph 2 DCCP, which contains facts and circumstances that lend itself to an investigation by an expert, must in principle be granted if the court does not have facts or considers any circumstances to warrant that allocation of the request is contrary to the best interests of the child (cf. HR September 5, 2014, ECLI: NL: HR: 2014: 2632, paragraph 3.3.2).

3.12.8.
Even if the expert investigation shows that [the mother 1] has sufficient parenting qualities to take care of [the minor 1] again (in the long term), the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that such an outcome cannot alter the fact that, as above under 3.11.6. has been judged, the "acceptable term" for [the minor 1] has passed. It is therefore established that the outcome of the investigation cannot be decisive for this decision. [the minor 1] can no longer wait for clarity about her perspective. Delaying the decision on the perspective of [the minor 1] therefore considers the court to be in conflict with the interest of [the minor 1]. In addition, it is sufficiently plausible that an expert investigation as requested under the given circumstances will only burden [the minor 1] (extra). For this reason too, the Court of Appeal considers the requested expert investigation to be in conflict with the interest of [the minor 1]. The court therefore rejects this request from [the mother 1].

3.13.
The foregoing means that the contested decision must be ratified, insofar as it is still subject to the judgment of the Court of Appeal, therefore insofar as the termination of the authority of [the mother 1] over [the minor 1] is concerned.

5 Decision
