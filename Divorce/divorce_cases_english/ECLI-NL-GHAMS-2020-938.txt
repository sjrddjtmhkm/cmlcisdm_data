3 Assessment
3.1
A preliminary hearing of witnesses was ordered by order of the Amsterdam District Court of 11 April 2019 at the request of [appellant]. For the purpose of the hearing on 18 July 2019, [appellant] called among others [mediator A] and [mediator B] (hereinafter jointly referred to as: the mediators) as witnesses. [defendant] and the mediators have taken the view that the mediators do not have to make a statement. They rely on article 4.2 of the mediation agreement in connection with article 7 of the regulations. [appellant] has argued that this appeal does not hold.

3.2
In the contested order, the court stated as follows:

"2.1 The [appellant's] commitment to the preliminary witness examination is to gather evidence that the

accusation of [intimidated] of rape made at various times and to different persons is not correct. According to [appellant], [defendant] confirmed to the mediators on May 13, 2017 that the allegation is not true. At the hearing on July 18, 2019, [appellant] stated that the use of the preliminary examination of witnesses is no longer to also collect evidence of a false accusation of [intimidated] of incest.

(…)

2.6.
The court states first of all that the mediation agreement can be regarded as an evidence agreement within the meaning of Article 153 DCCP. That is not up for discussion between the parties (and the mediators).

2.7.
Pursuant to Article 153 DCCP, agreements derogating from the legal evidence are not applicable when they relate to evidence of facts to which the law attaches consequences that are not at the free discretion of the parties, without prejudice to the grounds on which they are not applicable under the Dutch Civil Code. stay. In this case, there is no reason for declaring the evidence agreement inapplicable. The last phrase of Article 153 DCCP also includes cases in which an appeal to a proof of evidence is unacceptable according to standards of reasonableness and fairness (Article 6: 248 paragraph 2 of the Dutch Civil Code).

3 Appeal
2.8.
[Appellant] argues that a reasonable explanation of the evidence agreement means that it does not relate to the matter at issue. According to [appellant], the parties do not intend to apply the exclusion of evidence for this. The court rejects this position. The text of the present provisions is clear and there is no dispute as to the interpretation of its wording. In short, it follows from this: the mediator will not be heard by the parties as a witness about what has emerged and been exchanged during the mediation. [appellant] has not made any statements from which it can be deduced that the real intention of the mediators was to agree on a less far-reaching secrecy clause and evidence agreement than stated in the mediation agreement.

(…)

2.10.
The court is of the opinion that the appeal of the mediators to the evidence agreement is not unacceptable according to standards of reasonableness and fairness. In view of the essential nature of the confidentiality of the mediation, restraint should be allowed to allow the finding of truth to prevail if the parties themselves have chosen to take the risk that certain evidence cannot be provided. It is stipulated that [appellant] need not fear criminal prosecution. After all, [defendant] made a report to the police of rape in September 2015, but subsequently decided not to report it. In the eyes of [appellant], the false accusation had been "in the air" for almost two years when the mediation agreement was signed. At that time, [appellant] was able to take into account that at the time of the mediation this accusation would be discussed and [respondent] would comment on it. [Appellant] should thus be considered to have considered the situation which he believed had arisen - namely that [defendant] would admit to the mediators that the accusation was false. Nevertheless, by signing the mediation agreement, he relinquished hearing the mediators as witnesses in this regard, which may have consequences for the civil proceedings against [defendant] that he announced. This must be at his risk. The parallel that [appellant] sees in the judgment of the Zutphen court of 9 January 2007 (ECLI: NL: RBZUT: 2007: AZ6524) does not hold. In that case, the court determined that the mediator's duty of confidentiality does not extend to criminal offenses committed or evident misconduct committed by one of the parties or the mediator during the mediation process. That situation does not arise here. No other circumstances which justify that the finding of truth should prevail in this case have not been established or proved. "

The court subsequently determined that the mediators' appeal to the evidence agreement is successful and that they are not obliged to give a witness statement.

3.3
[appellant] disputes this decision and puts forward three complaints for that purpose. With appeal I in principal appeal, [appellant] argues that the court wrongly considered in 2.6 that the mediation agreement, or at least the confidentiality agreement in Article 4 of the mediation agreement, is an evidence agreement as referred to in Article 153 DCCP and that this is done by the parties is not contested. Complaint II in principal appeal means that in 2.8 the court wrongly considered that Article 4 of the mediation agreement must be interpreted in such a way that the parties have intended not to hear the mediators as witnesses about what has been shown or exchanged during the mediation, regardless of the nature or content thereof. With complaint III in principal appeal, [appellant] argues that in 2.10 the court wrongly considered that reasonableness and fairness do not preclude an appeal to secrecy and / or the refusal of the mediators to state what is said about the accusation of rape and incest has been said. Likewise, by means of complaint III, [appellant] wrongly considers the court's opinion that the importance of the mediation's confidentiality prevails over the truth-finding regarding the allegation of rape and incest.

3.4
[defendant] defends the complaints in principal appeal and has occasionally argued that [appellant] has no or insufficient interest in hearing the mediators as witnesses and that the court wrongly stated otherwise in the decision of 11 April 2019. decides. At the hearing, [defendant] indicated that the cross-appeal was brought under the condition that the principal appeal would succeed. That condition is not met, as will be seen below, for which reason the cross-appeal is further considered as not instituted. With regard to the principal appeal, the Court of Appeal considers as follows.

3.5.1
A mediation agreement was concluded on 11 May 2017 by [appellant], [defendant], [mediator B] and [mediator A]. Article 2 of this agreement stipulates that the regulations form an integral part of the mediation agreement, and that a copy of the regulations was attached to this agreement. Article 4 of the mediation agreement contains a confidentiality provision consisting of three paragraphs. Article 7 of the regulations contains a confidentiality provision consisting of six paragraphs. [appellant] has acknowledged that Article 4 of the mediation agreement applies between him, [defendant] and the mediators. However, he disputes the consequences that [respondent] and the mediators attach to it. [appellant] denies that Article 7 of the regulations applies (at least to him), at least that that article is part of the confidentiality agreement, because these regulations were not made available to him in time. [defendant] has contested the latter.

3.5.2
[appellant] has not substantiated disputed that, as Article 2 of the mediation agreement states, the regulations were attached to that agreement, at least he did not explicitly state that the regulations had not been attached in derogation from that provision. [appellant] merely stated that the regulations were not "made available to him". After [respondent] pointed out that an email was sent by the court mediation officer on 24 April 2017 with the subject “1st appointment with the mediator: Mediation on 200.212.047 / 01 + 200.212.042 / 01 [appellant] / [respondent] (mr. L. Laus) - [appellant] (mr. EJM van nieuwenhuizen) ”and that as attachments were attached to that e-mail: NMI mediationreglement.pdf; Model mediation agreement version 2014.doc; NMI code of conduct.pdf; R021-Mediation-next-to-family affairs.pdf; application form additions.pdf; Route descriptions Paleis IJdok 20.pdf, [appellant] reiterated at the hearing on appeal that the regulations were not made available to him. Perhaps his family law attorney mr. Van Nieuwenhuijzen knew these regulations, but he, [appellant], did not go through them personally. Mr. Van Nieuwenhuijzen was not involved in the mediation and therefore did not participate in it, according to [appellant]. In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, it has been sufficiently established with the relevant e-mail that the regulations have been sent to [appellant's] attorney and have thus been made available. This making available is equivalent to making available to [appellant]. Whether this lawyer has forwarded the relevant e-mail (with the regulations as an appendix) to [appellant], or whether it is correct what [respondent] states that the regulations were explicitly discussed at the second mediation meeting, may therefore be in the middle. stay. The Court of Appeal points out that if the regulations had not ended up with [appellant] at all, [appellant] could have been expected to report this, now Article 2 of the mediation agreement - and which agreement [appellant] signed - means that the regulations are attached. In conclusion, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that Article 7 of the regulations also applied to the mediation agreement between [appellant], [respondent] and the two mediators.

3.5.3
[appellant] has annulled the said article 7 of the regulations because this would be unreasonably onerous. However, [appellant] has not substantiated why the latter would be the case, so that the court ignores it. Incidentally, the court is unable to see what would be unreasonably onerous if the parties signed a confidentiality statement, as has been done in article 7 of the regulations.

3.5.4
[Appellant], on the occasion of the oral hearing on appeal under Article 6: 228 BW, requested the annulment of "the evidence agreement" for error. This appeal to error is out of time, after all, contrary to the two-conclusion rule, so that the court also ignores it.

4 Reasons of the Decision
3.5.5
The Court of Appeal is therefore of the opinion that the mediation agreement concluded between [appellant], [respondent] and the mediators is subject to both Article 4 of that agreement and Article 7 of the regulations.

3.6.1
Article 4 of the mediation agreement stipulates in paragraph 1 that the mediators, [respondent] and [appellant] undertake, without any reservation, to observe secrecy as described in Articles 7 and 10 of the regulations, and in paragraph 2 that “(t) this agreement ( …), In connection with the Regulations, (applies) as an evidence agreement within the meaning of the law, see art. 7: 900 BW jo. art. 153 Rv. ” It follows from this in the opinion of the Court of Appeal that the mediators, [respondent] and [appellant] intended to conclude an evidence agreement within the meaning of Article 153 DCCP. In addition, article 7 of the regulations describes what the mediators, [respondent] and [appellant] intend to do: no third parties, including judges, will be informed about the course of the mediation, the positions taken and the information provided orally or in writing. The mediators, [respondents] and [appellant] will not disclose documents to third parties, including judges, if these documents were disclosed during or in connection with the mediation. [defendant] and [appellant] waive the right, in court or otherwise, to prove what has been shown during the mediation as evidence against each other or to hear each other or the mediator or other parties involved in the mediation as witness about information that was provided during or in connection with the mediation. [defendant] and [appellant] are deemed to have concluded a proof of evidence for this, according to the last phrase of article 7.4 of the regulations.

3.6.2
In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, there is no other conclusion than that [respondent] and [appellant] have agreed that the positions they have taken during the mediation should not be made public (including: the judge) and that the intention was to conclude an evidence agreement that would not allow the mediators to be called as witness (es). The present situation is therefore fundamentally different from that which was decided by the Supreme Court on 10 April 2009 (LJN BG9470), because there was no explicit provision therein for entering into an evidence agreement. In the present situation, the parties have expressly entered into an evidence agreement, and the legal validity thereof is also not in question. Complaint I fails.

3.6.3
Article 7 of the regulations explicitly states that [respondent] and [appellant] agree, by way of evidence, to waive the right to summon the mediators as witness (es) to have them testify about information that has been provided during or in connection with the mediation. Complaint II, according to which the court wrongly interpreted Article 4 of the mediation agreement in such a way that the parties intended not to hear the mediators as witnesses about what was found or exchanged during the mediation, therefore fails. To the extent that complaint II argues that the mediators cannot be heard as witnesses about what has been found or exchanged during 'the mediation', but that the (alleged, after all, asserted by [appellant], but [disputed] statements of [ The Court of Appeal considers as follows with regard to the wrongful allegations that it has made against [appellant], because these statements would not fall under 'the mediation' and the confidentiality to be maintained thereby. The mediation agreement states as "global description of the Issue": "settlement of divorce". [Appellant] maintains that the subject on which he wishes to hear the mediators as witnesses relates to the (allegedly) false allegations [intimidated] made regarding [rape and incest] committed by [appellant] and the acknowledgment of [intimidated]. to the mediators that those allegations were not based on anything and that these events were not part of the subject matter of the mediation. [respondent] has disputed this and argued that the confidentiality related to everything that was discussed during the mediation.

3.6.4
By stating that [defendant] declared to the mediators that the rape and incest allegations she had made against [appellant] had been wrongly made, [appellant] invoked a statement that [defendant] made to the mediators. done. Article 7.1 of the regulations means that no information will be provided regarding the course of the mediation, the positions taken there and the information provided. Articles 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4 build on this. The text of the aforementioned articles therefore does not justify the view taken by [appellant] that the confidentiality would be limited to what constitutes the (main) subject of the mediation, and would not relate to matters that are outside that (main) subject. , but would have been declared to the mediator (s). [defendant] stated at the appeal hearing that he never accused [appellant] of incest. She did confirm that she stated, among other things to the police, that [appellant] raped her. However, it maintains that that statement was correct because the rape actually took place. Even if [respondent] had expressed himself to the mediator (s) about the correctness or incorrectness of that statement, it cannot be said that that statement was completely separate from the subject of the mediation, the settlement of the divorce. Insofar as [appellant ]'s argument fails. In view of the above, the Appellant Court also does not follow in its view that, despite the confidentiality statement (s) concluded, it could not have trusted that communications made by [intimidated] outside the subject of the mediation would not be part of that confidentiality. . On the occasion of the oral appeal, the [appellant] appealed to the exceptions to secrecy contained in Article 7.6, sub a and b of the regulations. This appeal is out of time, after all, contrary to the two-conclusion rule, so that the court also ignores it. For the sake of completeness, the Court of Appeal notes that the appeal does not apply in substance either, because defamation / slander is not an offense as referred to in Article 7.6, sub a, and it has not been established that there is a threat of a criminal offense as referred to under b. Complaint II fails.

3.7.1
With complaint III, [appellant] argues that it would be unacceptable, according to standards of reasonableness and fairness, if the mediator (s) were not required to testify about the, according to [appellant], acknowledgment by [appellant] that they [falsely] accused of something very serious like rape or incest. These very serious accusations infringe the privacy of [appellant] within the meaning of article 8 ECHR, and can also be regarded as an impairment of the mental integrity of [appellant] (as referred to in article 5 of the Implementation Directive Act). no. 2008/52 / EC), which in the case of international mediation would be grounds for the mediation of the non-disclosure of mediators, according to [appellant]. [Appellant] further argues that in the present case the finding of truth must give rise to this. In addition, he runs the risk that [defendant], contrary to what she now says she plans to do, will at some point file a criminal report against him. In his opinion, the testimony of the mediators "can put an end to the continued damage to his spiritual integrity."

3.7.2
The court does not follow [appellant] in his speech. The wording "unacceptable by standards of reasonableness and fairness" expresses that the assessment of this should be done with caution. Contrary to the importance of truth-finding mentioned by [appellant] - more about this below - is the interest that parties in mediation must be able to speak confidentially and, when a confidentiality statement is concluded as has happened here, they must also be able to rely on what during the mediation is declared, cannot come out in any way, not even during a hearing as a witness of the mediator (s). If, despite such a closed confidentiality statement, a mediator would be obliged to testify as a witness about what he heard during the mediation, this would seriously undermine the confidentiality to be expected by the parties. In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, there is no urgent emergency situation that could justify a breach of confidentiality by the mediator. Although the court recognizes that the rape allegation is a very serious one, it is not to be expected that a testimony by the mediator (s) will immediately bring an end to that matter. After all, the mediator (s) will / will not be able to explain anything other than that of what they have heard from [respondent], which does not mean, however, that what they have heard from her is also the truth. With regard to the interest mentioned by [appellant], that he should be able to defend himself in the future against a possible report by [respondent], the Court of Appeal considers that the relevant witness statement of the mediator (s) is not necessary for this. The reference to the Implementation Directive 2008/52 / EC Act is irrelevant, since this is not an appeal to the right of non-disclosure, but the consequences of an evidence contract. Complaint III fails.

3.8
The conclusion is that the grievances fail in principal appeal. The contested decision will be ratified. As the unsuccessful party in principal, [appellant] will be ordered to pay those costs.

5 Decision
The Council:

ratifies the contested decision;

orders [appellant] to pay the costs of the proceedings in principal appeal and budget these costs, in so far as on the part of [intimidated] cases, at € 332 in disbursements and € 2,148 in salary;
