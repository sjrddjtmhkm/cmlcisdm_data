1 Proceedings
Mr. M. Hoefs, lawyer, has lodged an appeal on behalf of the appellant and has applied for an order to pay damages in the form of statutory interest.

The College has lodged a statement of defense.

The investigation at the hearing, in conjunction with case 18/3135 PW, took place on July 16, 2019. The appellant has appeared, assisted by mr. Hoefs. The college was represented by R.J. Boes. In case 18/3135 PW a separate decision is being made today.

2 Facts
1. The Council assumes the following facts and circumstances relevant to this case.

1.1.
The appellant, her then husband X and three children were, after their move from residence A to a different address in residence B (specified address), registered there from 16 September 2016 in the Personal Records Database. X deregistered and registered on 24 September 2016 at the address of his mother in residence C. On 8 December 2016, the decision of the divorce pronounced between appellant and X was registered in the registers of civil status.

1.2.
By decision of October 14, 2016, the Board granted appellant and X assistance under the Participation Act as of August 16, 2016 to the standard for married couples and from September 22, 2016 to appellant according to the standard for a single parent.

1.3.
By decision of 8 February 2017, after objection was maintained by decision of 29 June 2017, the Commission terminated the appellant's assistance as of 8 February 2017 on the ground that the appellant had violated her obligation to provide information by not mentioning that she given address is in a joint household with X. To the extent relevant here, the court declared the appeal brought well founded, annulled the decision of 29 June 2017 and maintained the legal consequences of this annulled decision. In today's judgment in case 18/3135 PW, the Council confirmed the court's decision, insofar as it has been contested.

1.4.
On 15 February 2017, the appellant submitted another request for assistance to the standard for a single parent. In connection with the processing of the application, an intake interview took place on 1 March 2017 between the customer manager of the appellant (customer manager), the appellant and her authorized representative. The appellant then stated that X no longer had his main residence with her.

1.4.1.
By letter of 2 March 2017, the customer manager asked the appellant to provide a dated and signed statement, clearly stating which periods, days and times X stayed with her.

1.4.2.
By letter of 6 March 2017, the appellant informed the customer manager that X does not have his main residence at the specified address and that he only occasionally comes in connection with the children. The appellant hereby stated that X visited her seven times in the period from 13 February 2017 to 1 March 2017, stating the exact times.

3 Appeal
1.5.
The appellant filed a complaint against X on March 16, 2017, for simple abuse. In the declaration, appellant stated that she had a relationship with X from 26 July 2014 to 10 March 2017.

1.6.
By decision of 11 April 2017, after objection, insofar as relevant here, maintained by decision of 11 October 2017 (contested decision), the Board granted appellant assistance with effect from 10 March 2017 according to the standard for a single parent. The Commission has based this decision on the fact that it follows from the investigation, the appellant's statements during the intake and her statement to the police that the right to assistance only arose on March 10, 2017.

2. In the attacked judgment, the court declared the appeal against the contested decision unfounded.

3. On appeal, the appellant turned against the attacked judgment on the grounds to be discussed below.

4 Reasons of the Decision

4. The Council makes the following assessment.

4.1.
The period to be assessed runs from February 15, 2017, the date on which the appellant registered to request assistance, up to and including March 10, 2017, the date from which the Municipal Executive granted assistance to the appellant.

4.2.
By decision of 20 December 2016, ECLI: NL: CRVB: 2016: 4872, the Council amended its case-law on the review by the administrative court of decisions on a repeated application or a request for a decision to be reversed. This changed assessment framework also has consequences for decisions to reject an application for assistance after a previous withdrawal of assistance (judgment of 31 January 2017, ECLI: NL: CRVB: 2017: 365).

4.3.
In this case, the Municipal Executive rejected the application on the ground that the appellant has not demonstrated any change in circumstances after the previous withdrawal, in the sense that she now meets the conditions for the right to assistance. In view of the considerations under 4.2, the court has rightly limited itself in the judgment under appeal to the judgment it has given. Compare the judgment of 7 March 2017, ECLI: NL: CRVB: 2017: 998, legal consideration 4.6.3.

4.4.
As the Council has previously considered (judgment of 19 July 2011, ECLI: NL: CRVB: 2011: BR2972), if someone submits a new application for assistance to the standard for a single (parent), after the assistance has ended earlier, revised or withdrawn due to the running of a joint household and the person concerned - whether or not using remedies against that termination, revision or withdrawal - maintains that there is or has not been a joint household, in principle the applicant suffices with the substantiated statement that the (alleged) partner lives at a different address. If so, one of the criteria for establishing a joint household is no longer met, namely that both have their main residence in the same house. It is then up to the Commission to conduct further investigations if the correctness of this statement is doubted.

4.5.
The Commission based its decision of 8 February 2017, referred to in 1.3, on the findings of the home visit of that date to the specified address. During this home visit, mainly X items were found in the garden and in the shed, including clothing, toilet items, tools, administration and ladders. X's administration was also in the living room. X was also present in the house. The Commission also based this decision on information from municipality C of 31 January 2017, which showed that X, who had been registered there at the address of his mother, was officially deregistered on 26 January 2017 after an address investigation.

4.6.
The appellant has argued that she has substantiated that X lives at a different address from her. This appeal ground is unsuccessful.

4.6.1.
The appellant stated in the application that X no longer has his main residence with her, but that he will visit her in connection with the children. This statement is, in light of the ex-officio deregistration of X from the BrP on 26 January 2017, and it has not now been found that the appellant has stated in the context of her new application that the situation at the payment address had changed in the sense that no items of X more layers, insufficiently substantiated to compel the Commission to conduct further research as referred to under 4.4. In addition, the appellant stated at appeal that she cannot substantiate that X lives in C. The appellant's declaration of 16 March 2017, in which she stated, among other things, that she had a relationship with X until 10 March 2017, does not indicate a change in the actual living situation of X for that time. The fact that appellant meant by this that X did come to her for the children until 10 March 2017, which, of course, does not mean that appellant has sufficiently substantiated her claim about changed circumstances. Therefore, the Municipal Executive has not had to provide assistance to the appellant with effect from an earlier date than 10 March 2017.

4.7.
It follows from 4.1 to 4.6 that the appeal against the attacked judgment is unsuccessful, so it must be confirmed. It follows that the Board's request to order compensation for damage in the form of statutory interest must be rejected.

5. There is no reason for an order to pay the legal costs.
