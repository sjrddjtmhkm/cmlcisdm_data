- the parties were married in [place] [in] 2008;

- they are married after having entered into a prenuptial agreement involving the exclusion of any community of property.

On appeal, it appeared that the divorce decision was registered in the registers of civil status on 15 July 2019.

3 Scope of Dispute
4.1
By the contested decision, the divorce between the parties was pronounced and, executable on stock, compensated for the legal costs:

- a maintenance allowance of € 1,119 per month, payable by husband to wife, to be paid in advance for the first time on the day that the divorce decree is or will be entered in the registers of civil status;

- that the house at the [address] in [place], and the associated mortgage loan, are allocated to the man without further settlement;

- that within fourteen days of the date of the decision to be issued, the woman must hand over to the man the Cartier brand ladies watch of his late wife, forfeiting a penalty payment of € 250 for each day that the woman with the issue thereof will remain in default with a maximum of € 10,000;

- the husband must pay a living contribution of € 1,799 gross per month to the wife as of 1 September 2019, each time to be paid in advance;

- the husband is entitled to compensation under the simple community, consisting of the former matrimonial home, amounting to € 151,145.55 or alternatively € 159,831.75 and that the man is therefore to the woman an amount of primary € 12,367.45 or € 3,681.25 - consisting of the difference between the compensation right settled on delivery of the house to the man and the new compensation right to be determined - will have to be paid to the woman,

and further ratify the contested decision, at legal costs.

4.4
The man opposes this.

4 Reasons of the Decision
Partner maintenance

Needs and neediness of the woman

5.1
At the hearing, the parties agreed on the marriage-related need of the woman, namely € 2,877 net per month in 2019, in accordance with the court's opinion. Now that the need of the woman is no longer in dispute, the court will assume the aforementioned net need of the woman, being € 4,978 gross per month.

5.2
In view of the statements made by the woman at the hearing regarding her health, which were not or insufficiently contradicted by the man, the court is of the opinion that the woman has demonstrated that she cannot work more than the 14 hours that she now does . It has been found that the woman has a permanent contract in education for 10 hours and until 1 August 2020 temporarily an extra four hours per week. However, since December 10, 2019, the woman is in the Sickness Benefits Act. The man stated at the hearing that he agreed with the woman's calculations, as she submitted them as Appendix 33 to the fax of 28 January 2020. This concerns the period up to 1 August 2020. According to figures, based on the woman's own income of € 33,325 gross per year and the aforementioned need of the woman of € 2,877 net per month, there remains a need for an additional contribution. of the man's livelihood of € 1,402 gross per month. The court will then assess to what extent the man's ability to pay allows for this contribution.

Carrying capacity of the man

5.3
On the basis of the letter [chartered accountant] and [tax adviser] of 20 January 2020, which was submitted as Exhibit 32 on the part of the man, as well as the response from the side of the woman during the hearing, the income of the man discussed at length. It was apparent from the proceedings at the hearing that the court wrongly added the annuity payment, which ended on 1 February 2019, to the man's income. In view of the content of the procedural documents and the proceedings at the hearing, the court will determine the income of the man at the amount that has been entered by both the man and the woman in the most recent financial calculations. For this purpose, the court refers to the capacity calculations submitted by the woman as appendices 33 and 34 to her fax message of 28 January 2020 and the capacity calculations submitted by the man as exhibit 34 to the fax message of 29 January 2020. The court assumes income on the side of the man of € 56,243 gross per year.

5.4
With regard to the living expenses of the man, the court considers as follows. At the hearing, the man stated that the WOZ value of his home is € 275,000. The woman has not contradicted this amount, so the court assumes this amount and takes into account a notional rental value in 2019 of € 1,788 per year.

The woman states that the man has an annual interest charge on the mortgage loan of € 2,940. The man raises a higher interest charge of € 4,813 per year, but fails to substantiate this properly, given the motivated dispute by the woman. The court takes into account an interest charge of € 2,940 per year, as the court has presented parties to the hearing and has not been disputed by the parties. Finally, the court takes into account the fixed amount for other owner's expenses, including the VvE contribution of € 119 per month in 2019, which amount has not been disputed.

5.5
The man disputes that he is entitled to elderly person's tax credit. The woman's lawyer states that the maintenance calculation program that she uses automatically fills in this discount and that therefore an amount of € 1,068 has been included in her calculation. The court is of the opinion that, in view of his income as stated in 5.3, the man is not eligible for the elderly person's tax credit. The court takes into account the general tax credit of € 354 and the single elderly person's tax credit of € 429 in 2019, totaling € 783 in 2019.

5.6
The parties agree on the standard of assistance to be used by a single AOW pensioner of € 1,154 and the increased medical costs of € 135 per month and the compulsory deductible of € 385 per year.

5.7
Now that the parties have both raised a monthly amount of € 114.00 in other costs and € 100.00 in debt repayment, the court will take these amounts into account.

5.8
Furthermore, the man has argued that the court wrongly did not take into account a repayment on his current account debt when calculating the ability to pay. The man has explained how the current account debt arose and believes that this should be taken into account. In his appeal, he takes the view that the debt must be repaid with an amount of € 1,000 per month.

The man has 100% of the shares in [the holding company] The holding company has 100% of the shares in [the BV] As of 1 January 2008, [the vof], a hats trading company, was founded with the partners as [the BV ] and the son of the man, [the son of the man]. The man reached retirement age in 2016 and left employment as of [date in] 2016.

[tax adviser] and [chartered accountant] explained the current account debt at the hearing. The current account debt amounted to € 140,000 rounded in 2017, € 170,000 in 2018 and € 190,000 in 2019. They also explained why the debt could not be paid off until now, in connection with the need for the man to convert his own pension into an old-age provision.

5.9
The woman requests the court, like the court, not to take into account the reported current account debt. The woman has contested the necessity of the choices made by the man. In 2016, [the B.V.] waived a 50% profit share in the v.o.f., while there was no reason for this and nothing in return. For example, [the B.V.] is completely excluded from the distributing profit, while the B.V. of the man according to the woman is entitled to a profit share in the v.o.f. Clearly, a construction has been chosen to reduce his income. The man converted his self-administered pension into an old-age provision in 2017, while the amount used for this could have been used to repay the current account debt. The man still performs work for the v.o.f. and the v.o.f. uses a property that is 50% owned by [the B.V.] without paying a market-based rent. The man's company, the BV, is a company that has been established for 47 years and can get a credit of € 40,000, according to the woman.

5.10
In the opinion of the court, the man has demonstrated that there is a current account debt and that it was already present before the marriage. Reduction through dividend payments, as has happened in the past, is no longer possible because there is insufficient equity in [the holding]. The man has also made it plausible that the amount used for the old-age provision could not be used for repayment. In view of the tax consequences, this debt must be repaid. At the hearing, the man's accountant stated that, based on a current account debt of € 140,000, a repayment term of 10 years is realistic, also in view of the man's age. The court considers it reasonable to take into account, as the man also indicated in his appeal, a repayment on the current account debt of € 1,000 per month.

5.11
At the hearing, the parties agreed that the husband's accountant will send the annual accounts to the woman for information each year.

5.12
Based on the aforementioned income and expenses, the court calculates the man's capacity-free income at € 2,733 per month.

Gravy comparison

5.13
In man 5, the man asked the court for a comparison of the parties' financial situation, a so-called gravy comparison. On the side of the woman, the court takes into account the information as it has included it in its calculation, as it has included it as appendix 33 to the fax message of 28 January 2020 and has not or has not been sufficiently contested by the man. Taking into account a taxable annual income of € 33,325 gross and the tax credits of € 5,210, the woman has a net disposable income of € 2,178 per month. In addition, based on the monthly costs it has charged and the standard of assistance for a single person, the court calculates the capacity-free income of € 1,679 per month. Based on a comparison of these incomes, the parties are of the opinion of the Court of Appeal that with a partner's maintenance allowance of € 278 per month to be paid by the man to the woman, the parties will have the same gravy. The court has made a calculation of this and attaches it to the order. The court will thus determine and annul the contested decision to that extent.

5.14
Insofar as the woman has received more spousal maintenance than is due to her under this order, the court will determine, given the consumptive nature, that she will not have to repay any excess received.

Settlement of property disputes

5.15
In his sixth complaint, under marginal 32, the man raised his right to compensation with regard to the house that belongs to the parties in co-ownership. It follows from his explanation of the complaint that he believes that the fee should be higher.

5.16
The woman has put up a defense against the husband's complaint and has also raised the right to compensation in her cross-appeal under complaint 3.

5.17
At the hearing, the parties withdrew their complaints regarding the right to compensation, as it were. After the suspension of the oral hearing, they informed the court that there is an agreement with regard to the right to compensation and that the contested decision need not be annulled on that point.

5.18
It follows from the petition of the man that he is requesting from the woman the ladies' watch of the Cartier brand from his late wife.

5.19
The woman has put up a defense against this. In paragraph 92 of her defense, the woman states that the husband apparently wishes to receive gifts from her during the marriage. According to the woman, there is no legal basis for this.

5.20
The court considers as follows. It is certain that the woman is in possession of the Cartier watch. It is not disputed that the man gave this watch to the woman at or about marriage. The court infers from the woman's argument that the woman wore the watch during marriage. In the view of the court, there is a gift and there is therefore no legal basis for the woman to return the watch to the man.

5.21
The husband also demanded from the wife an amount of € 4,159.94 relating to an item of household costs. At the hearing, the man withdrew this claim.

5.22
Furthermore, it follows from the petition of the man that he also claims an amount from the woman of € 1,470.74 in respect of funeral and life insurance premiums paid. The man also withdrew this claim at the hearing.

5.23
In complaint 8 of his appeal, the man states that the washing machine, sufficiently known to the parties, was financed by the man's company. The man is of the opinion that this washing machine therefore does not belong to co-owned parties. The man also withdrew this complaint at the hearing.

Distribution of co-ownership, house [place]

5.24
In the petition, the man requests that the house be allocated to the man at the [address] in [place] and the associated mortgage loan without further settlement.

5.25
The court considers as follows. The man did not provide any explanation about his claim in his appeal. First, the court notes that a debt cannot be assigned, since a debt is no good. Secondly, it follows from the contested decision that the woman's share in the home is allocated to the man. Thirdly, it follows from what has been considered above with regard to the compensation right that the parties have reached agreement on this. The man therefore no longer has an interest in his claim, now that his wishes have also been met.

5.26
In view of the above, the court decides as follows.

5 Decision
The Council:

annuls the contested decision only insofar as it concerns the spousal maintenance determined therewith and, insofar as it has a new disposition:

determines, as of July 15, 2019, the maintenance for the woman to be borne by the man at € 278 per month, with regard to the installments to be paid as of today, to be paid in advance;

stipulates that the wife does not have to repay any excess received to the husband;

declares this decision enforceable to the extent that it is in stock;

dismisses on appeal more or otherwise requested.

This decision was made by mrs. A.N. Labohm, A.E. Sutorius-van Hees and A.S. Mertens-de Jong, assisted by Mr. A.C. van Waning as Registrar, and pronounced in open court on April 22, 2020.
