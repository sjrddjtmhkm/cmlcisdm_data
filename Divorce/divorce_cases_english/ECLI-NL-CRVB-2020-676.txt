1 Proceedings

On behalf of the appellant, mr. D.J. Bomhof, lawyer, brought an appeal.

The College has lodged a statement of defense.

Pursuant to Article 8:57, first paragraph, of the General Administrative Law Act (Awb), an investigation was omitted, after which the Council closed the investigation in application of Article 8:57, third paragraph, of the Awb.

2 Facts
1. The Council assumes the following facts and circumstances relevant to this case.

1.1.
By decision of 26 November 2013, the Municipal Executive brought appellant with effect from

November 23, 2013 assistance granted to the standard for a single parent. The Commission has also granted appellant € 400 in special assistance for the costs of paint and wallpaper. The appellant was still married to X at the time, but they were in divorce. According to the divorce settlement submitted by the appellant, the joint home of appellant and X would be sold and transferred to the first interested party who made an acceptable offer. It also followed from the covenant that the appellant was entitled to half of the marital community, being € 101,688.05. In the decision of 26 November 2013, the Municipal Executive informed the appellant that, as soon as the divorce had been completed, it was required to provide copies of the division of the estate, maintenance, court order and sale of the house.

1.2.
The Northern Netherlands court delivered the divorce on February 19, 2014. On June 10, 2014, the divorce was entered in the registers of the Civil Registry.

1.3.
The appellant's assistance was terminated with effect from 1 March 2015, because the appellant's income from that time exceeded the applicable assistance standard.

1.4.
By decision of 16 November 2016, the College appellant pointed out with regard to the assets in the estate that as soon as the money from the matrimonial home would become available, the right to assistance for the period from 23 November 2013 to

February 28, 2015 would be revised again.

1.5.
In the context of a re-examination, the Commission requested the appellant by letter of 26 January 2017 to provide evidence of the sale of the house. In response to this, the appellant has indicated that X has bought her out of the joint home, has received an amount of € 85,000 on her bank account on 3 January 2017 and that she had already paid an amount of € 15,000 in the year before the official divorce, - had received.

1.6.
By decision of 13 September 2017, after an objection has been maintained by decision of 9 July 2018 (contested decision), the Commission provided the period for the period from 23 November 2013 to

On 28 February 2015, the costs of assistance from the appellant were recovered to an amount of € 12,881.20. The Commission has based its decision-making on the fact that the amount of € 100,000 is attributed to the appellant's assets on 23 November 2013. In view of the maximum assets to be released of € 10,590 at the time of the granting of the assistance, the appellant's assets exceeded the maximum assets to be released by an amount of € 89,410. This amount is much higher than the assistance provided to the appellant. In view of the provisions of Article 58, second paragraph, preamble and under f, under 1, of the Participation Act (PW), the Municipal Executive is entitled to reclaim any assistance that has been wrongly provided afterwards. Pursuant to the Policy Rules for Revision, Revocation and Recovery of the Municipality of Tytsjerksteradiel 2014, a situation such as this also involves a recovery.

2. In the attacked judgment, the court declared the appeal against the contested decision unfounded. To this end, the court has considered that it follows from Article 58, second paragraph, preamble and under f sub 1 of the PW that the Municipal Executive was able to reclaim the assistance of the appellant, because they subsequently considered the dispose or may dispose of resources to be taken. It has not been established circumstances on the grounds of which the Municipal Executive was unable to exercise its powers of recovery. It is not in dispute that the appellant received € 100,000. When determining the size of the resources to be taken into account, the Commission rightly took the value at the time when the appellant had access to the resources, therefore at the time of the sale of the house. In this context, the court has referred to settled case law of the Council (for example, the judgment of

February 28, 2006, ECLI: NL: CRVB: 2006: AV3011). There is no question of a situation in which the appellant was or was not aware of a recovery of assistance after receipt of funds after the divorce had been completed. In the award decision, the Board pointed out to the appellant that, as soon as her divorce was finalized, she had to submit documents to the Board. In the decision of 16 November 2016, the Appellant also pointed to a review of her assistance after receiving the money from the former marital home. The statement by [name] - insofar as it is relevant, that she appeared with the appellant at an appointment for a WWB application and that she has absolutely no recollection that there was then talk of repayment of assistance - does not alter this. in spite of the fact that it has neither been stated nor shown that a commitment to that effect has been made on the part of the Municipal Executive. The appellant has not further substantiated why the recovery amount would not be correct.

3 Appeal

3. On appeal, the appellant argued that the Board wrongly looked at the value of the house at the time of the sale of the house, not being the moment of receipt of assistance, for determining the assets. In addition, the assistance was not conditionally granted at the time.

4 Reasons of the Decision
4. The Council makes the following assessment.

4.1.
The grounds raised by the appellant on appeal are a repetition of what she appealed on appeal. The court is motivated to consider these grounds. The appellant has not put forward any reasons why the reasoned refutation of the grounds invoked in the appeal in the attacked judgment is incorrect or incomplete. The Council fully endorses the judgment of the court and the considerations, as set out under 2, on which that judgment rests.

4.2.
It follows from 4.1 that the appeal is unsuccessful, so the attacked judgment must be confirmed.

5. There is no reason for an order to pay the legal costs.

5 Decision
The Central Board of Appeal confirms the attacked judgment.

This statement was made by M. Hillen, in the presence of A.A.H. Ibrahim as a registrar. The decision was pronounced in public on March 17, 2020.
