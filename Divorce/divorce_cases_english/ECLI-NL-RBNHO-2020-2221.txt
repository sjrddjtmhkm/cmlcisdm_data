At the beginning of July 2019, the mother moved with [minor] to [place], where the mother's partner lives. Both the mother and [minor] are still registered in [place]. The mother deregistered [minor] from the primary school [elementary school] in [place] in the summer and enrolled her in an elementary school in [place].

2.4.
By judgment of 12 September 2019 (of the summary proceedings brought by the father), the mother under 5.1 was sentenced to return [minor] to the marital home in [place] within two days after the judgment was served 5.2 prohibited to move with [minor] outside a radius of 30 kilometers from [place]. Conditionally, in case the mother does not comply with these convictions, the judgment stipulates that [minor] has her primary residence with the father for the time being and a provisional care arrangement has been established, whereby [minor] has one weekend every two weeks with the mother is staying.

2.6.
The order of the mother to grant her substitute permission to move with [minor] to [place] was rejected by order of (the multiple chamber of) this court of 29 January 2020.

2.7.
On January 31, 2020, the father wrote the following email message to the mother:

"Hi

You really want to go to [place] which is understandable. I am willing to let you move to [place], you see it like this and [minor] is one?

But then you have to come up with a very good proposal. Eg as already [minor] every other week with me in [place], holidays 50/50. In good consultation between us, for example, you spend half a week and I half a holiday. Summer holidays in good consultation.

You bring and get [minor] to [place], you want to live further than 30 km!

Plus everything on paper!

Think about it, [minor] would like this better too.

Have a good weekend ”

2.8.
On February 14, 2020, the mother moved with [minor] to [place] and agreed with the principal of the primary school in [place] that [minor] may attend education as a guest pupil at that school.

2.9.
On February 21, 2020, the father again had the judgment of September 12, 2019 and also the decision of January 29, 2020 served on the mother, whereby the mother is summoned “to again by February 24, 2020 with [minor] within a radius of Move 30 kilometers around [place], until a different decision has been made in the basic proceedings. "

2.10.
The mother did not return to the matrimonial home in [place] (or any other home within a radius of 30 kilometers around [place]) by [minor] by February 24, 2020 (or thereafter). She is staying with [minor] in [place]. [minor] is not enrolled but goes to school there as a guest pupil. The father informed the school attendance officer that [minor] did not appear at primary school [primary school] in [place] where she is registered on January 24, 2020.

2.11.
Safe Home Kennemerland (through [name]) wrote in its email message of February 24, 2020 to parties (among others):

“Based on our findings, we have decided to create a new file ex officio. I will request the Youth Protection Table to have the Child Protection Board further investigate the upbringing and living situation of your daughter, with the aim of realizing supervision. ”

3 Scope of Dispute
3.1.
The father claims that the preliminary relief judge by judgment, as far as practicable with stock:

the mother orders to immediately return [minor] to the matrimonial home in [place], but at the latest within two days after this judgment;

the mother orders to pay a penalty of € 500 per day for every day that she has not complied with the command under 1) with a maximum of € 50,000;

grants the father leave for immediate enforcement of compulsion (and therefore sets the period as referred to in Article 591 DCCP to nil) if the mother has not complied with the command under 1 within seven days of this judgment;

provides that - until a final decision has been made in the divorce proceedings - [minor] has her principal residence with the father;

provides that - until a final decision has been made in the divorce proceedings - a care scheme is established, in the sense that [minor] stays with her mother for one weekend during the fortnight from Friday afternoon to Sunday afternoon, with [minor] picked up by her mother and is brought;

provides that the father - until the final decision has been taken in the divorce proceedings - is entitled to the exclusive use of the marital home;

suspends the parental authority of the mother until a final decision has been made in divorce proceedings;

the mother orders the costs of the proceedings.

3.2.
The father bases his claims on the following. The mother has left again to [place] without the consent of the father and in violation of a court order imposing periodic penalty payments and in breach of a judicial judgment motivated by the multiple chamber. She considers her own interest in being able to live with her boyfriend outweigh the interest of [minor] staying in her familiar environment. It has become clear that the mother cannot be held back, even if the penalties attached (and notified) have not induced the mother to comply with those commandments. For that reason, the father again claims to order the mother to lead [minor] back to the matrimonial home in [place], this time imposing periodic penalty payments and physical coercion.

For the period that has not yet been decided in the divorce proceedings, the father further claims that [minor] has his primary residence with him, that he has the exclusive use of the marital home and that a care arrangement is established between [minor] and the mother. To prevent the mother from changing the place of residence of [minor] again and enrolling her in another school without the father's permission, the father claims to suspend the parental authority of the mother for this period. Given the attitude of the mother, the father considers a cost order appropriate.

3.3.
The mother puts forward the following defense. According to the mother, in his email message of 31 January 2020, the father gave her permission to move with [minor] to [place], provided that she meets the conditions set by the father regarding handling and transport. On 2 February 2020, when the father was with MZ with [minor], he also told grandmother that he had given the mother his consent. The mother concluded from this that the father was finally tacked. She has stopped preparations for an appeal and left for [place] with [minor]. On 3 February 2020, the mother proposed a care scheme in accordance with the wishes of the father and will comply with it. For reasons unknown to the mother, the father subsequently withdrew his consent. The mother will now appeal against the decision of January 29, 2020, in which the request to grant her replacement consent was rejected.

3.4.
Insofar as relevant, the statements of the parties will be discussed below.

4 Reasons of the Decision
4.1.
The preliminary relief judge states that the following provisional relief measures have been given by order of 28 February 2019. [minor] is entrusted to the mother,

the exclusive use of the marital home has been assigned to the mother, and a provisional care arrangement has been established, which means that [minor] will stay with the father (during a seven-week cycle) in weeks 1, 4 and 7: Friday from school until Sunday 19.00 (possibly until Monday to school), in week 2: Friday from school until Saturday 19.00 and in weeks 3, 5 and 6: an afternoon in consultation and there is a child contribution to be paid by the father to the mother of € 400 per month determined. These provisions will continue to apply until a final decision has been made in the main proceedings.

4.2.
The preliminary relief judge finds that the mother moved to [place] in July 2019 without (the required) consent of the father with [minor]. In a summary judgment of 12 September 2019, the mother was sentenced to return [minor] to the marital home in [place]. The mother did not comply with this verdict. During the oral hearing of a subsequent interim injunction on October 10, 2019, the parties made arrangements and agreed that the mother would return to the matrimonial home with [minor]. On 24 October 2019, the mother with [minor] actually returned to the matrimonial home in [place]. In a preliminary relief judgment of 21 November 2019, the mother's claim to suspend the judgment of 12 September 2019 pending the main proceedings was dismissed and in the main proceedings the decision to grant her replacement permission for relocation was made by decision of 29 January 2020. , finally rejected by the multiple chamber.

It is established that the mother moved to [place] again on February 14, 2020 with [minor]. On 21 February 2020, the father had the summary judgment of 12 September 2019 and the decision of 29 January 2020 served on the mother. Nevertheless, the mother has not returned and is still staying in [place], where she lets [minor] go to school.

4.3.
The mother's argument that the father in his email message of January 31, 2020 still gave the mother permission to move with [minor] to [place] is not followed. It cannot simply be deduced from this message that the father has given permission to the mother to move to [place] with [minor]. After all, the father writes in that email that he gives permission if the mother comes up with a good proposal about handling and transport, and that this must be put on paper. Although the mother states that she made a written proposal on February 3, 2020, it has not stated or it has been established that the parties have subsequently reached an agreement. In light of the foregoing, the father's email message cannot be interpreted as anything other than an invitation to the mother to engage in a conversation and make a proposal. In any case, unconditional permission cannot be read, partly in view of the history in which the father has always opposed the move of [minor] with mother. In addition, shortly after the mother's proposal and before the mother's departure for [place], the father informed her that he was not giving permission.

4.4.
Now that the father has not given permission to the mother to move with [minor] to [place], the mother must return her to the marital home in [place]. The preliminary relief judge will give the mother time for this this week, so that [minor] can go back to primary school [primary school] in [place] on Monday 9 March 2020. The claim under 1) will be allocated in this way.

The preliminary relief judge assumes that the mother, to whom [minor] has been entrusted, will take up residence in the marital home, the exclusive use of which has been assigned to her, and furthermore that she will implement the provisional care arrangement, as laid down in the interim relief decision of 28 February 2019.

4.5.
The means of coercion, as the father has demanded, is only discussed as an ultimum remedium, namely when other means of coercion, both direct and indirect, no longer benefit. The mother has not returned to the marital home in [place] with [minor], even after notice of the penalty payments forfeited (under the summary judgment of 12 September 2019). Furthermore, the mother refuses to comply with the order of the multiple chamber of this court in which her request for replacement permission for relocation was rejected. By leaving or returning to [place] with [minor] repeatedly, in violation of those judicial decisions, or not in return for the father's consent, the mother shows that she is not persuaded to comply with court decisions by means of periodic penalty payments. Therefore, the preliminary relief judge sees no other option than to impose the advanced physical coercion as the ultimate coercive measure to induce the mother to comply with the moving ban. The claim under 3) will therefore be upheld for a period of one month. In addition, there is no longer any reason to impose a penalty payment so that the claim under 2 is rejected.

4.6.
The following applies to the claim under 4, 5 and 6. The father hereby claims to determine the main residence of [minor] with him for the duration of the divorce proceedings, to entrust [minor] to him and to establish contact arrangements with the mother. In doing so, the father is actually requesting an amendment to the interim provisions determined by order of 28 February 2019. Now that the claims of father under 1 and 3 are granted, the father has a parental interest only in his claims under 4, 5 and 6, namely in case the mother does not comply with the conviction and the execution of the body is enforced. However, the father has not made those claims conditionally so that they will be dismissed.

In addition, the preliminary relief judge noted that if it came to the use of forced coercion, this would lead to the mother, who is the main caregiver of [minor], being removed from the environment of [minor] for a month, which is very burdensome would be for [minor]. The facilities judge therefore assumes that the father will take care of [minor] during a possible period of forced labor and offer as much stability as possible to [minor] when it comes to her living environment, including home and school. As the father explained at the hearing, with the help of his parents, he can temporarily take on full care for [minor].

4.7.
With regard to the suspension of parental authority of the mother claimed by the father under 7, the preliminary relief judge ruled as follows. Such suspension of parental authority is intended for crisis situations. The law therefore provides for the possibility of suspension if there is a serious suspicion that a child grows up in such a way that it is seriously threatened in its development or the parent abuses authority and the measure is necessary to remove an acute and serious threat to the minor. whether medical treatment of the minor is necessary to avert serious danger to his health and refuse permission from a parent exercising authority. Now that none of the aforementioned circumstances have been raised or proved in this case, the claim under 7) will be dismissed.

4.8.
For the sake of completeness, the preliminary relief judge observes that the mother's course of action means that [minor] is torn between [place] and [place] and has switched schools more than once in a short period. This course of events can be harmful to the development of [minor]. The preliminary relief judge finds that Safe Home will ex officio request the Child Protection Board to request further research into the living and upbringing situation of [minor] with the aim of realizing supervision. The preliminary relief judge therefore urges parties to cooperate in the Parenthood Continues process in the interest of [minor].

4.9.
The preliminary relief judge sees in the attitude of the mother a reason to order her to pay the legal costs, estimated to date at € 406.96 in disbursements and € 980 in salary for the lawyer.

5 Decision
The preliminary relief judge

5.1.
orders the mother to immediately return [minor], at least no later than 8 March 2020, to the marital home in [place];

5.2.
grants leave to the father for immediate execution of compulsion for a period of one month (and therefore sets the period as referred to in Article 591 DCCP to nil) if the mother has not complied with the commandment under 5.1 by Sunday 8 March 2020;

5.3.
orders the mother to pay the costs of these proceedings, estimated to date on

€ 406.96 in disbursements and € 980 in salary for the lawyer;

5.4.
declares this judgment as far as enforceable with stock;

5.5.
rejects the more or otherwise advanced.

This judgment was rendered by mr. J.C.M. Swinkels and pronounced in public in the presence of the registrar mr. J.J. Blaisse on March 5, 2020.
